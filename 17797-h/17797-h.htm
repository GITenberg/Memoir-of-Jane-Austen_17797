<h2><!-- page ii--><a name="pageii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. ii</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The Memoir</span> of my <span class="smcap">Aunt</span>,
<span class="smcap">Jane Austen</span>, has been received with more
favour than I had ventured to expect.&nbsp; The notices taken of it
in the periodical press, as well as letters addressed to me by many
with whom I am not personally acquainted, show that an unabated interest
is still taken in every particular that can be told about her.&nbsp;
I am thus encouraged not only to offer a Second Edition of the Memoir,
but also to enlarge it with some additional matter which I might have
scrupled to intrude on the public if they had not thus seemed to call
for it.&nbsp; In the present Edition, the narrative is somewhat enlarged,
and a few more letters are added; with a short specimen of her childish
stories.&nbsp; The cancelled chapter of &lsquo;Persuasion&rsquo; is
given, in compliance with wishes both publicly and privately expressed.&nbsp;
A fragment of a story entitled &lsquo;The Watsons&rsquo; is printed;
<!-- page iii--><a name="pageiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. iii</span>
and extracts are given from a novel which she had begun a few months
before her death; but the chief addition is a short tale never before
published, called &lsquo;Lady Susan.&rsquo; <a name="citation0a"></a><a href="#footnote0a">{0a}</a>&nbsp;
I regret that the little which I have been able to add could not appear
in my First Edition; as much of it was either unknown to me, or not
at my command, when I first published; and I hope that I may claim some
indulgent allowance for the difficulty of recovering little facts and
feelings which had been merged half a century deep in oblivion.</p>

<p><i>Introductory Remarks&mdash;Birth of Jane Austen&mdash;Her Family
Connections&mdash;Their Influence on her Writings</i>.</p>
<p>More than half a century has passed away since I, the youngest of
the mourners, <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1">{1}</a> attended
the funeral of my dear aunt Jane in Winchester Cathedral; and now, in
my old age, I am asked whether my memory will serve to rescue from oblivion
any events of her life or any traits of her character to satisfy the
enquiries of a generation of readers who have been born since she died.&nbsp;
Of events her life was singularly barren: few changes and no great crisis
<!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>ever
broke the smooth current of its course.&nbsp; Even her fame may be said
to have been posthumous: it did not attain to any vigorous life till
she had ceased to exist.&nbsp; Her talents did not introduce her to
the notice of other writers, or connect her with the literary world,
or in any degree pierce through the obscurity of her domestic retirement.&nbsp;
I have therefore scarcely any materials for a detailed life of my aunt;
but I have a distinct recollection of her person and character; and
perhaps many may take an interest in a delineation, if any such can
be drawn, of that prolific mind whence sprung the Dashwoods and Bennets,
the Bertrams and Woodhouses, the Thorpes and Musgroves, who have been
admitted as familiar guests to the firesides of so many families, and
are known there as individually and intimately as if they were living
neighbours.&nbsp; Many may care to know whether the moral rectitude,
the correct taste, and the warm affections with which she invested her
ideal characters, were really existing in the native source whence those
ideas flowed, and were actually exhibited by her in the various relations
of life.&nbsp; I can indeed bear witness that there was scarcely a charm
in her most delightful characters that was not a true reflection of
her own sweet temper and loving heart.&nbsp; I was young when we lost
her; but the impressions made on the young are deep, and though in the
course of fifty years I have forgotten much, I have not forgotten that
&lsquo;Aunt Jane&rsquo; was the delight of all her nephews and <!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>nieces.&nbsp;
We did not think of her as being clever, still less as being famous;
but we valued her as one always kind, sympathising, and amusing.&nbsp;
To all this I am a living witness, but whether I can sketch out such
a faint outline of this excellence as shall be perceptible to others
may be reasonably doubted.&nbsp; Aided, however, by a few survivors
<a name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3">{3}</a> who knew her, I
will not refuse to make the attempt.&nbsp; I am the more inclined to
undertake the task from a conviction that, however little I may have
to tell, no one else is left who could tell so much of her.</p>
<p>Jane Austen was born on December 16, 1775, at the Parsonage House
of Steventon in Hampshire.&nbsp; Her father, the Rev. George Austen,
was of a family long established in the neighbourhood of Tenterden and
Sevenoaks in Kent.&nbsp; I believe that early in the seventeenth century
they were clothiers.&nbsp; Hasted, in his history of Kent, says: &lsquo;The
clothing business was exercised by persons who possessed most of the
landed property in the Weald, insomuch that almost all the ancient families
of these parts, now of large estates and genteel rank in life, and some
of them ennobled by titles, are sprung from ancestors who <!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>have
used this great staple manufacture, now almost unknown here.&rsquo;&nbsp;
In his list of these families Hasted places the Austens, and he adds
that these clothiers &lsquo;were usually called the Gray Coats of Kent;
and were a body so numerous and united that at county elections whoever
had their vote and interest was almost certain of being elected.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The family still retains a badge of this origin; for their livery is
of that peculiar mixture of light blue and white called Kentish gray,
which forms the facings of the Kentish militia.</p>
<p>Mr. George Austen had lost both his parents before he was nine years
old.&nbsp; He inherited no property from them; but was happy in having
a kind uncle, Mr. Francis Austen, a successful lawyer at Tunbridge,
the ancestor of the Austens of Kippington, who, though he had children
of his own, yet made liberal provision for his orphan nephew.&nbsp;
The boy received a good education at Tunbridge School, whence he obtained
a scholarship, and subsequently a fellowship, at St. John&rsquo;s College,
Oxford.&nbsp; In 1764 he came into possession of the two adjoining Rectories
of Deane and Steventon in Hampshire; the former purchased for him by
his generous uncle Francis, the latter given by his cousin Mr. Knight.&nbsp;
This was no very gross case of plurality, according to the ideas of
that time, for the two villages were little more than a mile apart,
and their united populations scarcely amounted to three hundred.&nbsp;
In the same year he married <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>Cassandra,
youngest daughter of the Rev. Thomas Leigh, of the family of Leighs
of Warwickshire, who, having been a fellow of All Souls, held the College
living of Harpsden, near Henley-upon-Thames.&nbsp; Mr. Thomas Leigh
was a younger brother of Dr. Theophilus Leigh, a personage well known
at Oxford in his day, and his day was not a short one, for he lived
to be ninety, and held the Mastership of Balliol College for above half
a century.&nbsp; He was a man more famous for his sayings than his doings,
overflowing with puns and witticisms and sharp retorts; but his most
serious joke was his practical one of living much longer than had been
expected or intended.&nbsp; He was a fellow of Corpus, and the story
is that the Balliol men, unable to agree in electing one of their own
number to the Mastership, chose him, partly under the idea that he was
in weak health and likely soon to cause another vacancy.&nbsp; It was
afterwards said that his long incumbency had been a judgment on the
Society for having elected an <i>Out-College Man</i>. <a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5">{5}</a>&nbsp;
I imagine that the front of Balliol towards Broad Street which has recently
been pulled down must have been built, or at least restored, while he
was Master, for the Leigh arms were placed under the cornice at the
corner nearest to Trinity gates.&nbsp; The beautiful building lately
erected has destroyed this record, <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>and
thus &lsquo;monuments themselves memorials need.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His fame for witty and agreeable conversation extended beyond the
bounds of the University.&nbsp; Mrs. Thrale, in a letter to Dr. Johnson,
writes thus: &lsquo;Are you acquainted with Dr. Leigh, <a name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6">{6}</a>
the Master of Balliol College, and are you not delighted with his gaiety
of manners and youthful vivacity, now that he is eighty-six years of
age?&nbsp; I never heard a more perfect or excellent pun than his, when
some one told him how, in a late dispute among the Privy Councillors,
the Lord Chancellor struck the table with such violence that he split
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; replied the Master; &ldquo;I can
hardly persuade myself that he <i>split</i> the <i>table</i>, though
I believe he <i>divided</i> the <i>Board</i>.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Some of his sayings of course survive in family tradition.&nbsp;
He was once calling on a gentleman notorious for never opening a book,
who took him into a room overlooking the Bath Road, which was then a
great thoroughfare for travellers of every class, saying rather pompously,
&lsquo;This, Doctor, I call my study.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Doctor, glancing
his eye round the room, in which no books were to be seen, replied,
&lsquo;And very well named too, sir, for you know Pope tells us, &ldquo;The
proper <i>study</i> of mankind is <i>Man</i>.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; When
my father went to Oxford he was honoured with an invitation to dine
with this dignified cousin.&nbsp; <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>Being
a raw undergraduate, unaccustomed to the habits of the University, he
was about to take off his gown, as if it were a great coat, when the
old man, then considerably turned eighty, said, with a grim smile, &lsquo;Young
man, you need not strip: we are not going to fight.&rsquo;&nbsp; This
humour remained in him so strongly to the last that he might almost
have supplied Pope with another instance of &lsquo;the ruling passion
strong in death,&rsquo; for only three days before he expired, being
told that an old acquaintance was lately married, having recovered from
a long illness by eating eggs, and that the wits said that he had been
egged on to matrimony, he immediately trumped the joke, saying, &lsquo;Then
may the yoke sit easy on him.&rsquo;&nbsp; I do not know from what common
ancestor the Master of Balliol and his great-niece Jane Austen, with
some others of the family, may have derived the keen sense of humour
which they certainly possessed.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. George Austen resided first at Deane, but removed in
1771 to Steventon, which was their residence for about thirty years.&nbsp;
They commenced their married life with the charge of a little child,
a son of the celebrated Warren Hastings, who had been committed to the
care of Mr. Austen before his marriage, probably through the influence
of his sister, Mrs. Hancock, whose husband at that time held some office
under Hastings in India.&nbsp; Mr. Gleig, in his &lsquo;Life of Hastings,&rsquo;
says that his son George, the offspring of his first marriage, was sent
<!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>to
England in 1761 for his education, but that he had never been able to
ascertain to whom this precious charge was entrusted, nor what became
of him.&nbsp; I am able to state, from family tradition, that he died
young, of what was then called putrid sore throat; and that Mrs. Austen
had become so much attached to him that she always declared that his
death had been as great a grief to her as if he had been a child of
her own.</p>
<p>About this time, the grandfather of Mary Russell Mitford, Dr. Russell,
was Rector of the adjoining parish of Ashe; so that the parents of two
popular female writers must have been intimately acquainted with each
other.</p>
<p>As my subject carries me back about a hundred years, it will afford
occasions for observing many changes gradually effected in the manners
and habits of society, which I may think it worth while to mention.&nbsp;
They may be little things, but time gives a certain importance even
to trifles, as it imparts a peculiar flavour to wine.&nbsp; The most
ordinary articles of domestic life are looked on with some interest,
if they are brought to light after being long buried; and we feel a
natural curiosity to know what was done and said by our forefathers,
even though it may be nothing wiser or better than what we are daily
doing or saying ourselves.&nbsp; Some of this generation may be little
aware how many conveniences, now considered to be necessaries and matters
of course, were unknown to their <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>grandfathers
and grandmothers.&nbsp; The lane between Deane and Steventon has long
been as smooth as the best turnpike road; but when the family removed
from the one residence to the other in 1771, it was a mere cart track,
so cut up by deep ruts as to be impassable for a light carriage.&nbsp;
Mrs. Austen, who was not then in strong health, performed the short
journey on a feather-bed, placed upon some soft articles of furniture
in the waggon which held their household goods.&nbsp; In those days
it was not unusual to set men to work with shovel and pickaxe to fill
up ruts and holes in roads seldom used by carriages, on such special
occasions as a funeral or a wedding.&nbsp; Ignorance and coarseness
of language also were still lingering even upon higher levels of society
than might have been expected to retain such mists.&nbsp; About this
time, a neighbouring squire, a man of many acres, referred the following
difficulty to Mr. Austen&rsquo;s decision: &lsquo;You know all about
these sort of things.&nbsp; Do tell us.&nbsp; Is Paris in France, or
France in Paris? for my wife has been disputing with me about it.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The same gentleman, narrating some conversation which he had heard between
the rector and his wife, represented the latter as beginning her reply
to her husband with a round oath; and when his daughter called him to
task, reminding him that Mrs. Austen never swore, he replied, &lsquo;Now,
Betty, why do you pull me up for nothing? that&rsquo;s neither here
nor there; you know very well that&rsquo;s only <i>my way of telling
the story</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>Attention
has lately been called by a celebrated writer to the inferiority of
the clergy to the laity of England two centuries ago.&nbsp; The charge
no doubt is true, if the rural clergy are to be compared with that higher
section of country gentlemen who went into parliament, and mixed in
London society, and took the lead in their several counties; but it
might be found less true if they were to be compared, as in all fairness
they ought to be, with that lower section with whom they usually associated.&nbsp;
The smaller landed proprietors, who seldom went farther from home than
their county town, from the squire with his thousand acres to the yeoman
who cultivated his hereditary property of one or two hundred, then formed
a numerous class&mdash;each the aristocrat of his own parish; and there
was probably a greater difference in manners and refinement between
this class and that immediately above them than could now be found between
any two persons who rank as gentlemen.&nbsp; For in the progress of
civilisation, though all orders may make some progress, yet it is most
perceptible in the lower.&nbsp; It is a process of &lsquo;levelling
up;&rsquo; the rear rank &lsquo;dressing up,&rsquo; as it were, close
to the front rank.&nbsp; When Hamlet mentions, as something which he
had &lsquo;for <i>three years taken</i> note of,&rsquo; that &lsquo;the
toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier,&rsquo; it
was probably intended by Shakspeare as a satire on his own times; but
it expressed a principle which is working at all times in which society
makes any <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>progress.&nbsp;
I believe that a century ago the improvement in most country parishes
began with the clergy; and that in those days a rector who chanced to
be a gentleman and a scholar found himself superior to his chief parishioners
in information and manners, and became a sort of centre of refinement
and politeness.</p>
<p>Mr. Austen was a remarkably good-looking man, both in his youth and
his old age.&nbsp; During his year of office at Oxford he had been called
the &lsquo;handsome Proctor;&rsquo; and at Bath, when more than seventy
years old, he attracted observation by his fine features and abundance
of snow-white hair.&nbsp; Being a good scholar he was able to prepare
two of his sons for the University, and to direct the studies of his
other children, whether sons or daughters, as well as to increase his
income by taking pupils.</p>
<p>In Mrs. Austen also was to be found the germ of much of the ability
which was concentrated in Jane, but of which others of her children
had a share.&nbsp; She united strong common sense with a lively imagination,
and often expressed herself, both in writing and in conversation, with
epigrammatic force and point.&nbsp; She lived, like many of her family,
to an advanced age.&nbsp; During the last years of her life she endured
continual pain, not only patiently but with characteristic cheerfulness.&nbsp;
She once said to me, &lsquo;Ah, my dear, you find me just where you
left me&mdash;on the sofa.&nbsp; I sometimes think that God Almighty
must have forgotten me; but I dare say He will <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>come
for me in His own good time.&rsquo;&nbsp; She died and was buried at
Chawton, January 1827, aged eighty-eight.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Her own family were so much, and the rest of the world so little,
to Jane Austen, that some brief mention of her brothers and sister is
necessary in order to give any idea of the objects which principally
occupied her thoughts and filled her heart, especially as some of them,
from their characters or professions in life, may be supposed to have
had more or less influence on her writings: though I feel some reluctance
in bringing before public notice persons and circumstances essentially
private.</p>
<p>Her eldest brother James, my own father, had, when a very young man,
at St. John&rsquo;s College, Oxford, been the originator and chief supporter
of a periodical paper called &lsquo;The Loiterer,&rsquo; written somewhat
on the plan of the &lsquo;Spectator&rsquo; and its successors, but nearly
confined to subjects connected with the University.&nbsp; In after life
he used to speak very slightingly of this early work, which he had the
better right to do, as, whatever may have been the degree of their merits,
the best papers had certainly been written by himself.&nbsp; He was
well read in English literature, had a correct taste, and wrote readily
and happily, both in prose and verse.&nbsp; He was more than ten years
older than Jane, and had, I believe, a large share in directing her
reading and forming her taste.</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>Her
second brother, Edward, had been a good deal separated from the rest
of the family, as he was early adopted by his cousin, Mr. Knight, of
Godmersham Park in Kent and Chawton House in Hampshire; and finally
came into possession both of the property and the name.&nbsp; But though
a good deal separated in childhood, they were much together in after
life, and Jane gave a large share of her affections to him and his children.&nbsp;
Mr. Knight was not only a very amiable man, kind and indulgent to all
connected with him, but possessed also a spirit of fun and liveliness,
which made him especially delightful to all young people.</p>
<p>Her third brother, Henry, had great conversational powers, and inherited
from his father an eager and sanguine disposition.&nbsp; He was a very
entertaining companion, but had perhaps less steadiness of purpose,
certainly less success in life, than his brothers.&nbsp; He became a
clergyman when middle-aged; and an allusion to his sermons will be found
in one of Jane&rsquo;s letters.&nbsp; At one time he resided in London,
and was useful in transacting his sister&rsquo;s business with her publishers.</p>
<p>Her two youngest brothers, Francis and Charles, were sailors during
that glorious period of the British navy which comprises the close of
the last and the beginning of the present century, when it was impossible
for an officer to be almost always afloat, as these brothers were, without
seeing service which, in these days, would be considered <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>distinguished.&nbsp;
Accordingly, they were continually engaged in actions of more or less
importance, and sometimes gained promotion by their success.&nbsp; Both
rose to the rank of Admiral, and carried out their flags to distant
stations.</p>
<p>Francis lived to attain the very summit of his profession, having
died, in his ninety-third year, G.C.B. and Senior Admiral of the Fleet,
in 1865.&nbsp; He possessed great firmness of character, with a strong
sense of duty, whether due from himself to others, or from others to
himself.&nbsp; He was consequently a strict disciplinarian; but, as
he was a very religious man, it was remarked of him (for in those days,
at least, it was remarkable) that he maintained this discipline without
ever uttering an oath or permitting one in his presence.&nbsp; On one
occasion, when ashore in a seaside town, he was spoken of as &lsquo;<i>the</i>
officer who kneeled at church;&rsquo; a custom which now happily would
not be thought peculiar.</p>
<p>Charles was generally serving in frigates or sloops; blockading harbours,
driving the ships of the enemy ashore, boarding gun-boats, and frequently
making small prizes.&nbsp; At one time he was absent from England on
such services for seven years together.&nbsp; In later life he commanded
the Bellerophon, at the bombardment of St. Jean d&rsquo;Acre in 1840.&nbsp;
In 1850 he went out in the Hastings, in command of the East India and
China station, but on the breaking out of the Burmese war he transferred
his flag to a <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>steam
sloop, for the purpose of getting up the shallow waters of the Irrawaddy,
on board of which he died of cholera in 1852, in the seventy-fourth
year of his age.&nbsp; His sweet temper and affectionate disposition,
in which he resembled his sister Jane, had secured to him an unusual
portion of attachment, not only from his own family, but from all the
officers and common sailors who served under him.&nbsp; One who was
with him at his death has left this record of him: &lsquo;Our good Admiral
won the hearts of all by his gentleness and kindness while he was struggling
with disease, and endeavouring to do his duty as Commander-in-chief
of the British naval forces in these waters.&nbsp; His death was a great
grief to the whole fleet.&nbsp; I know that I cried bitterly when I
found he was dead.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Order in Council of the Governor-General
of India, Lord Dalhousie, expresses &lsquo;admiration of the staunch
high spirit which, notwithstanding his age and previous sufferings,
had led the Admiral to take his part in the trying service which has
closed his career.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These two brothers have been dwelt on longer than the others because
their honourable career accounts for Jane Austen&rsquo;s partiality
for the Navy, as well as for the readiness and accuracy with which she
wrote about it.&nbsp; She was always very careful not to meddle with
matters which she did not thoroughly understand.&nbsp; She never touched
upon politics, law, or medicine, subjects which some novel writers have
ventured on rather too boldly, and <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>have
treated, perhaps, with more brilliancy than accuracy.&nbsp; But with
ships and sailors she felt herself at home, or at least could always
trust to a brotherly critic to keep her right.&nbsp; I believe that
no flaw has ever been found in her seamanship either in &lsquo;Mansfield
Park&rsquo; or in &lsquo;Persuasion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But dearest of all to the heart of Jane was her sister Cassandra,
about three years her senior.&nbsp; Their sisterly affection for each
other could scarcely be exceeded.&nbsp; Perhaps it began on Jane&rsquo;s
side with the feeling of deference natural to a loving child towards
a kind elder sister.&nbsp; Something of this feeling always remained;
and even in the maturity of her powers, and in the enjoyment of increasing
success, she would still speak of Cassandra as of one wiser and better
than herself.&nbsp; In childhood, when the elder was sent to the school
of a Mrs. Latournelle, in the Forbury at Reading, the younger went with
her, not because she was thought old enough to profit much by the instruction
there imparted, but because she would have been miserable without her
sister; her mother observing that &lsquo;if Cassandra were going to
have her head cut off, Jane would insist on sharing her fate.&rsquo;&nbsp;
This attachment was never interrupted or weakened.&nbsp; They lived
in the same home, and shared the same bed-room, till separated by death.&nbsp;
They were not exactly alike.&nbsp; Cassandra&rsquo;s was the colder
and calmer disposition; she was always prudent and well judging, but
with less outward demonstration of feeling and less <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>sunniness
of temper than Jane possessed.&nbsp; It was remarked in her family that
&lsquo;Cassandra had the <i>merit</i> of having her temper always under
command, but that Jane had the <i>happiness</i> of a temper that never
required to be commanded.&rsquo;&nbsp; When &lsquo;Sense and Sensibility&rsquo;
came out, some persons, who knew the family slightly, surmised that
the two elder Miss Dashwoods were intended by the author for her sister
and herself; but this could not be the case.&nbsp; Cassandra&rsquo;s
character might indeed represent the &lsquo;<i>sense</i>&rsquo; of Elinor,
but Jane&rsquo;s had little in common with the &lsquo;<i>sensibility</i>&rsquo;
of Marianne.&nbsp; The young woman who, before the age of twenty, could
so clearly discern the failings of Marianne Dashwood, could hardly have
been subject to them herself.</p>
<p>This was the small circle, continually enlarged, however, by the
increasing families of four of her brothers, within which Jane Austen
found her wholesome pleasures, duties, and interests, and beyond which
she went very little into society during the last ten years of her life.&nbsp;
There was so much that was agreeable and attractive in this family party
that its members may be excused if they were inclined to live somewhat
too exclusively within it.&nbsp; They might see in each other much to
love and esteem, and something to admire.&nbsp; The family talk had
abundance of spirit and vivacity, and was never troubled by disagreements
even in little matters, for it was not their habit to dispute or argue
with each other: above all, there was strong <!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>family
affection and firm union, never to be broken but by death.&nbsp; It
cannot be doubted that all this had its influence on the author in the
construction of her stories, in which a family party usually supplies
the narrow stage, while the interest is made to revolve round a few
actors.</p>
<p>It will be seen also that though her circle of society was small,
yet she found in her neighbourhood persons of good taste and cultivated
minds.&nbsp; Her acquaintance, in fact, constituted the very class from
which she took her imaginary characters, ranging from the member of
parliament, or large landed proprietor, to the young curate or younger
midshipman of equally good family; and I think that the influence of
these early associations may be traced in her writings, especially in
two particulars.&nbsp; First, that she is entirely free from the vulgarity,
which is so offensive in some novels, of dwelling on the outward appendages
of wealth or rank, as if they were things to which the writer was unaccustomed;
and, secondly, that she deals as little with very low as with very high
stations in life.&nbsp; She does not go lower than the Miss Steeles,
Mrs. Elton, and John Thorpe, people of bad taste and underbred manners,
such as are actually found sometimes mingling with better society.&nbsp;
She has nothing resembling the Brangtons, or Mr. Dubster and his friend
Tom Hicks, with whom Madame D&rsquo;Arblay loved to season her stories,
and to produce striking contrasts to her well bred characters.</p>

II.</h2>
<p><i>Description of Steventon&mdash;Life at Steventon&mdash;Changes
of Habits and Customs in the last Century</i>.</p>
<p>As the first twenty-five years, more than half of the brief life
of Jane Austen, were spent in the parsonage of Steventon, some description
of that place ought to be given.&nbsp; Steventon is a small rural village
upon the chalk hills of north Hants, situated in a winding valley about
seven miles from Basingstoke.&nbsp; The South-Western railway crosses
it by a short embankment, and, as it curves round, presents a good view
of it on the left hand to those who are travelling down the line, about
three miles before entering the tunnel under Popham Beacon.&nbsp; It
may be known to some sportsmen, as lying in one of the best portions
of the Vine Hunt.&nbsp; It is certainly not a picturesque country; it
presents no grand or extensive views; but the features are small rather
than plain.&nbsp; The surface continually swells and sinks, but the
hills are not bold, nor the valleys deep; and though it is sufficiently
well clothed with woods and hedgerows, yet the poverty of the soil in
most places prevents the timber from attaining a large size.&nbsp; Still
it has its beauties.&nbsp; The lanes wind along in a natural curve,
continually <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>fringed
with irregular borders of native turf, and lead to pleasant nooks and
corners.&nbsp; One who knew and loved it well very happily expressed
its quiet charms, when he wrote</p>
<blockquote><p>True taste is not fastidious, nor rejects,<br />
Because they may not come within the rule<br />
Of composition pure and picturesque,<br />
Unnumbered simple scenes which fill the leaves<br />
Of Nature&rsquo;s sketch book.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of this somewhat tame country, Steventon, from the fall of the ground,
and the abundance of its timber, is certainly one of the prettiest spots;
yet one cannot be surprised that, when Jane&rsquo;s mother, a little
before her marriage, was shown the scenery of her future home, she should
have thought it unattractive, compared with the broad river, the rich
valley, and the noble hills which she had been accustomed to behold
at her native home near Henley-upon-Thames.</p>
<p>The house itself stood in a shallow valley, surrounded by sloping
meadows, well sprinkled with elm trees, at the end of a small village
of cottages, each well provided with a garden, scattered about prettily
on either side of the road.&nbsp; It was sufficiently commodious to
hold pupils in addition to a growing family, and was in those times
considered to be above the average of parsonages; but the rooms were
finished with less elegance than would now be found in the most ordinary
dwellings.&nbsp; No cornice marked the junction of wall and ceiling;
while the <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>beams
which supported the upper floors projected into the rooms below in all
their naked simplicity, covered only by a coat of paint or whitewash:
accordingly it has since been considered unworthy of being the Rectory
house of a family living, and about forty-five years ago it was pulled
down for the purpose of erecting a new house in a far better situation
on the opposite side of the valley.</p>
<p>North of the house, the road from Deane to Popham Lane ran at a sufficient
distance from the front to allow a carriage drive, through turf and
trees.&nbsp; On the south side the ground rose gently, and was occupied
by one of those old-fashioned gardens in which vegetables and flowers
are combined, flanked and protected on the east by one of the thatched
mud walls common in that country, and overshadowed by fine elms.&nbsp;
Along the upper or southern side of this garden, ran a terrace of the
finest turf, which must have been in the writer&rsquo;s thoughts when
she described Catharine Morland&rsquo;s childish delight in &lsquo;rolling
down the green slope at the back of the house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the chief beauty of Steventon consisted in its hedgerows.&nbsp;
A hedgerow, in that country, does not mean a thin formal line of quickset,
but an irregular border of copse-wood and timber, often wide enough
to contain within it a winding footpath, or a rough cart track.&nbsp;
Under its shelter the earliest primroses, anemones, and wild hyacinths
were to be found; sometimes, the first bird&rsquo;s-nest; and, now and
<!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>then,
the unwelcome adder.&nbsp; Two such hedgerows radiated, as it were,
from the parsonage garden.&nbsp; One, a continuation of the turf terrace,
proceeded westward, forming the southern boundary of the home meadows;
and was formed into a rustic shrubbery, with occasional seats, entitled
&lsquo;The Wood Walk.&rsquo;&nbsp; The other ran straight up the hill,
under the name of &lsquo;The Church Walk,&rsquo; because it led to the
parish church, as well as to a fine old manor-house, of Henry VIII.&rsquo;s
time, occupied by a family named Digweed, who have for more than a century
rented it, together with the chief farm in the parish.&nbsp; The church
itself&mdash;I speak of it as it then was, before the improvements made
by the present rector&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little spireless
fane,<br />
Just seen above the woody lane,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>might have appeared mean and uninteresting to an ordinary observer;
but the adept in church architecture would have known that it must have
stood there some seven centuries, and would have found beauty in the
very narrow early English windows, as well as in the general proportions
of its little chancel; while its solitary position, far from the hum
of the village, and within sight of no habitation, except a glimpse
of the gray manor-house through its circling screen of sycamores, has
in it something solemn and appropriate to the last resting-place of
the silent dead.&nbsp; Sweet violets, both purple and white, grow in
abundance beneath its south wall.&nbsp; <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>One
may imagine for how many centuries the ancestors of those little flowers
have occupied that undisturbed, sunny nook, and may think how few living
families can boast of as ancient a tenure of their land.&nbsp; Large
elms protrude their rough branches; old hawthorns shed their annual
blossoms over the graves; and the hollow yew-tree must be at least coeval
with the church.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/manorhouse.jpg">
<img alt="Steventon Manor House" src="images/manorhouse.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>But whatever may be the beauties or defects of the surrounding scenery,
this was the residence of Jane Austen for twenty-five years.&nbsp; This
was the cradle of her genius.&nbsp; These were the first objects which
inspired her young heart with a sense of the beauties of nature.&nbsp;
In strolls along those wood-walks, thick-coming fancies rose in her
mind, and gradually assumed the forms in which they came forth to the
world.&nbsp; In that simple church she brought them all into subjection
to the piety which ruled her in life, and supported her in death.</p>
<p>The home at Steventon must have been, for many years, a pleasant
and prosperous one.&nbsp; The family was unbroken by death, and seldom
visited by sorrow.&nbsp; Their situation had some peculiar advantages
beyond those of ordinary rectories.&nbsp; Steventon was a family living.&nbsp;
Mr. Knight, the patron, was also proprietor of nearly the whole parish.&nbsp;
He never resided there, and consequently the rector and his children
came to be regarded in the neighbourhood as a kind of representatives
of the family.&nbsp; They shared with the principal tenant the command
<!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>of
an excellent manor, and enjoyed, in this reflected way, some of the
consideration usually awarded to landed proprietors.&nbsp; They were
not rich, but, aided by Mr. Austen&rsquo;s powers of teaching, they
had enough to afford a good education to their sons and daughters, to
mix in the best society of the neighbourhood, and to exercise a liberal
hospitality to their own relations and friends.&nbsp; A carriage and
a pair of horses were kept.&nbsp; This might imply a higher style of
living in our days than it did in theirs.&nbsp; There were then no assessed
taxes.&nbsp; The carriage, once bought, entailed little further expense;
and the horses probably, like Mr. Bennet&rsquo;s, were often employed
on farm work.&nbsp; Moreover, it should be remembered that a pair of
horses in those days were almost necessary, if ladies were to move about
at all; for neither the condition of the roads nor the style of carriage-building
admitted of any comfortable vehicle being drawn by a single horse.&nbsp;
When one looks at the few specimens still remaining of coach-building
in the last century, it strikes one that the chief object of the builders
must have been to combine the greatest possible weight with the least
possible amount of accommodation.</p>
<p>The family lived in close intimacy with two cousins, Edward and Jane
Cooper, the children of Mrs. Austen&rsquo;s eldest sister, and Dr. Cooper,
the vicar of Sonning, near Reading.&nbsp; The Coopers lived for some
years at Bath, which seems to have been <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>much
frequented in those days by clergymen retiring from work.&nbsp; I believe
that Cassandra and Jane sometimes visited them there, and that Jane
thus acquired the intimate knowledge of the topography and customs of
Bath, which enabled her to write &lsquo;Northanger Abbey&rsquo; long
before she resided there herself.&nbsp; After the death of their own
parents, the two young Coopers paid long visits at Steventon.&nbsp;
Edward Cooper did not live undistinguished.&nbsp; When an undergraduate
at Oxford, he gained the prize for Latin hexameters on &lsquo;Hortus
Anglicus&rsquo; in 1791; and in later life he was known by a work on
prophecy, called &lsquo;The Crisis,&rsquo; and other religious publications,
especially for several volumes of Sermons, much preached in many pulpits
in my youth.&nbsp; Jane Cooper was married from her uncle&rsquo;s house
at Steventon, to Captain, afterwards Sir Thomas Williams, under whom
Charles Austen served in several ships.&nbsp; She was a dear friend
of her namesake, but was fated to become a cause of great sorrow to
her, for a few years after the marriage she was suddenly killed by an
accident to her carriage.</p>
<p>There was another cousin closely associated with them at Steventon,
who must have introduced greater variety into the family circle.&nbsp;
This was the daughter of Mr. Austen&rsquo;s only sister, Mrs. Hancock.&nbsp;
This cousin had been educated in Paris, and married to a Count de Feuillade,
of whom I know little more than that he perished by the guillotine during
the <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>French
Revolution.&nbsp; Perhaps his chief offence was his rank; but it was
said that the charge of &lsquo;incivism,&rsquo; under which he suffered,
rested on the fact of his having laid down some arable land into pasture&mdash;a
sure sign of his intention to embarrass the Republican Government by
producing a famine!&nbsp; His wife escaped through dangers and difficulties
to England, was received for some time into her uncle&rsquo;s family,
and finally married her cousin Henry Austen.&nbsp; During the short
peace of Amiens, she and her second husband went to France, in the hope
of recovering some of the Count&rsquo;s property, and there narrowly
escaped being included amongst the <i>d&eacute;tenus</i>.&nbsp; Orders
had been given by Buonaparte&rsquo;s government to detain all English
travellers, but at the post-houses Mrs. Henry Austen gave the necessary
orders herself, and her French was so perfect that she passed everywhere
for a native, and her husband escaped under this protection.</p>
<p>She was a clever woman, and highly accomplished, after the French
rather than the English mode; and in those days, when intercourse with
the Continent was long interrupted by war, such an element in the society
of a country parsonage must have been a rare acquisition.&nbsp; The
sisters may have been more indebted to this cousin than to Mrs. La Tournelle&rsquo;s
teaching for the considerable knowledge of French which they possessed.&nbsp;
She also took the principal parts in the private theatricals in which
the family several times indulged, having their summer <!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>theatre
in the barn, and their winter one within the narrow limits of the dining-room,
where the number of the audience must have been very limited.&nbsp;
On these occasions, the prologues and epilogues were written by Jane&rsquo;s
eldest brother, and some of them are very vigorous and amusing.&nbsp;
Jane was only twelve years old at the time of the earliest of these
representations, and not more than fifteen when the last took place.&nbsp;
She was, however, an early observer, and it may be reasonably supposed
that some of the incidents and feelings which are so vividly painted
in the Mansfield Park theatricals are due to her recollections of these
entertainments.</p>
<p>Some time before they left Steventon, one great affliction came upon
the family.&nbsp; Cassandra was engaged to be married to a young clergyman.&nbsp;
He had not sufficient private fortune to permit an immediate union;
but the engagement was not likely to be a hopeless or a protracted one,
for he had a prospect of early preferment from a nobleman with whom
he was connected both by birth and by personal friendship.&nbsp; He
accompanied this friend to the West Indies, as chaplain to his regiment,
and there died of yellow fever, to the great concern of his friend and
patron, who afterwards declared that, if he had known of the engagement,
he would not have permitted him to go out to such a climate.&nbsp; This
little domestic tragedy caused great and lasting grief to the principal
sufferer, and could not but cast a gloom over the whole party.&nbsp;
The sympathy of <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>Jane
was probably, from her age, and her peculiar attachment to her sister,
the deepest of all.</p>
<p>Of Jane herself I know of no such definite tale of love to relate.&nbsp;
Her reviewer in the &lsquo;Quarterly&rsquo; of January 1821 observes,
concerning the attachment of Fanny Price to Edmund Bertram: &lsquo;The
silence in which this passion is cherished, the slender hopes and enjoyments
by which it is fed, the restlessness and jealousy with which it fills
a mind naturally active, contented, and unsuspicious, the manner in
which it tinges every event, and every reflection, are painted with
a vividness and a detail of which we can scarcely conceive any one but
a female, and we should almost add, a female writing from recollection,
capable.&rsquo;&nbsp; This conjecture, however probable, was wide of
the mark.&nbsp; The picture was drawn from the intuitive perceptions
of genius, not from personal experience.&nbsp; In no circumstance of
her life was there any similarity between herself and her heroine in
&lsquo;Mansfield Park.&rsquo;&nbsp; She did not indeed pass through
life without being the object of warm affection.&nbsp; In her youth
she had declined the addresses of a gentleman who had the recommendations
of good character, and connections, and position in life, of everything,
in fact, except the subtle power of touching her heart.&nbsp; There
is, however, one passage of romance in her history with which I am imperfectly
acquainted, and to which I am unable to assign name, or date, or place,
though I have it on sufficient authority.&nbsp; <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>Many
years after her death, some circumstances induced her sister Cassandra
to break through her habitual reticence, and to speak of it.&nbsp; She
said that, while staying at some seaside place, they became acquainted
with a gentleman, whose charm of person, mind, and manners was such
that Cassandra thought him worthy to possess and likely to win her sister&rsquo;s
love.&nbsp; When they parted, he expressed his intention of soon seeing
them again; and Cassandra felt no doubt as to his motives.&nbsp; But
they never again met.&nbsp; Within a short time they heard of his sudden
death.&nbsp; I believe that, if Jane ever loved, it was this unnamed
gentleman; but the acquaintance had been short, and I am unable to say
whether her feelings were of such a nature as to affect her happiness.</p>
<p>Any description that I might attempt of the family life at Steventon,
which closed soon after I was born, could be little better than a fancy-piece.&nbsp;
There is no doubt that if we could look into the households of the clergy
and the small gentry of that period, we should see some things which
would seem strange to us, and should miss many more to which we are
accustomed.&nbsp; Every hundred years, and especially a century like
the last, marked by an extraordinary advance in wealth, luxury, and
refinement of taste, as well as in the mechanical arts which embellish
our houses, must produce a great change in their aspect.&nbsp; These
changes are always at work; they are going on now, but so silently that
we take no <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>note
of them.&nbsp; Men soon forget the small objects which they leave behind
them as they drift down the stream of life.&nbsp; As Pope says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Nor does life&rsquo;s stream for observation stay;<br />
It hurries all too fast to mark their way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Important inventions, such as the applications of steam, gas, and
electricity, may find their places in history; but not so the alterations,
great as they may be, which have taken place in the appearance of our
dining and drawing-rooms.&nbsp; Who can now record the degrees by which
the custom prevalent in my youth of asking each other to take wine together
at dinner became obsolete?&nbsp; Who will be able to fix, twenty years
hence, the date when our dinners began to be carved and handed round
by servants, instead of smoking before our eyes and noses on the table?&nbsp;
To record such little matters would indeed be &lsquo;to chronicle small
beer.&rsquo;&nbsp; But, in a slight memoir like this, I may be allowed
to note some of those changes in social habits which give a colour to
history, but which the historian has the greatest difficulty in recovering.</p>
<p>At that time the dinner-table presented a far less splendid appearance
than it does now.&nbsp; It was appropriated to solid food, rather than
to flowers, fruits, and decorations.&nbsp; Nor was there much glitter
of plate upon it; for the early dinner hour rendered candlesticks unnecessary,
and silver forks had not come into general use: while the broad rounded
<!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>end
of the knives indicated the substitute generally used instead of them.
<a name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31">{31}</a></p>
<p>The dinners too were more homely, though not less plentiful and savoury;
and the bill of fare in one house would not be so like that in another
as it is now, for family receipts were held in high estimation.&nbsp;
A grandmother of culinary talent could bequeath to her descendant fame
for some particular dish, and might influence the family dinner for
many generations.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dos est magna parentium<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Virtus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One house would pride itself on its ham, another on its game-pie,
and a third on its superior furmity, or tansey-pudding.&nbsp; Beer and
home-made wines, especially mead, were more largely consumed.&nbsp;
Vegetables were less plentiful and less various.&nbsp; Potatoes were
used, but not so abundantly as now; and there was an idea that they
were to be eaten only with roast meat.&nbsp; They were novelties to
a <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>tenant&rsquo;s
wife who was entertained at Steventon Parsonage, certainly less than
a hundred years ago; and when Mrs. Austen advised her to plant them
in her own garden, she replied, &lsquo;No, no; they are very well for
you gentry, but they must be terribly <i>costly to rear</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But a still greater difference would be found in the furniture of
the rooms, which would appear to us lamentably scanty.&nbsp; There was
a general deficiency of carpeting in sitting-rooms, bed-rooms, and passages.&nbsp;
A pianoforte, or rather a spinnet or harpsichord, was by no means a
necessary appendage.&nbsp; It was to be found only where there was a
decided taste for music, not so common then as now, or in such great
houses as would probably contain a billiard-table.&nbsp; There would
often be but one sofa in the house, and that a stiff, angular, uncomfortable
article.&nbsp; There were no deep easy-chairs, nor other appliances
for lounging; for to lie down, or even to lean back, was a luxury permitted
only to old persons or invalids.&nbsp; It was said of a nobleman, a
personal friend of George III. and a model gentleman of his day, that
he would have made the tour of Europe without ever touching the back
of his travelling carriage.&nbsp; But perhaps we should be most struck
with the total absence of those elegant little articles which now embellish
and encumber our drawing-room tables.&nbsp; We should miss the sliding
bookcases and picture-stands, the letter-weighing machines and envelope
cases, the <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>periodicals
and illustrated newspapers&mdash;above all, the countless swarm of photograph
books which now threaten to swallow up all space.&nbsp; A small writing-desk,
with a smaller work-box, or netting-case, was all that each young lady
contributed to occupy the table; for the large family work-basket, though
often produced in the parlour, lived in the closet.</p>
<p>There must have been more dancing throughout the country in those
days than there is now: and it seems to have sprung up more spontaneously,
as if it were a natural production, with less fastidiousness as to the
quality of music, lights, and floor.&nbsp; Many country towns had a
monthly ball throughout the winter, in some of which the same apartment
served for dancing and tea-room.&nbsp; Dinner parties more frequently
ended with an extempore dance on the carpet, to the music of a harpsichord
in the house, or a fiddle from the village.&nbsp; This was always supposed
to be for the entertainment of the young people, but many, who had little
pretension to youth, were very ready to join in it.&nbsp; There can
be no doubt that Jane herself enjoyed dancing, for she attributes this
taste to her favourite heroines; in most of her works, a ball or a private
dance is mentioned, and made of importance.</p>
<p>Many things connected with the ball-rooms of those days have now
passed into oblivion.&nbsp; The barbarous law which confined the lady
to one partner throughout the evening must indeed have been abolished
before Jane went to balls.&nbsp; It must <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>be
observed, however, that this custom was in one respect advantageous
to the gentleman, inasmuch as it rendered his duties more practicable.&nbsp;
He was bound to call upon his partner the next morning, and it must
have been convenient to have only one lady for whom he was obliged</p>
<blockquote><p>To gallop all the country over,<br />
The last night&rsquo;s partner to behold,<br />
And humbly hope she caught no cold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the stately minuet still reigned supreme; and every regular ball
commenced with it.&nbsp; It was a slow and solemn movement, expressive
of grace and dignity, rather than of merriment.&nbsp; It abounded in
formal bows and courtesies, with measured paces, forwards, backwards
and sideways, and many complicated gyrations.&nbsp; It was executed
by one lady and gentleman, amidst the admiration, or the criticism,
of surrounding spectators.&nbsp; In its earlier and most palmy days,
as when Sir Charles and Lady Grandison delighted the company by dancing
it at their own wedding, the gentleman wore a dress sword, and the lady
was armed with a fan of nearly equal dimensions.&nbsp; Addison observes
that &lsquo;women are armed with fans, as men with swords, and sometimes
do more execution with them.&rsquo;&nbsp; The graceful carriage of each
weapon was considered a test of high breeding.&nbsp; The clownish man
was in danger of being tripped up by his sword getting between his legs:
the fan held clumsily looked more of a burden than an ornament; while
in the hands of an adept <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>it
could be made to speak a language of its own. <a name="citation35"></a><a href="#footnote35">{35}</a>&nbsp;
It was not everyone who felt qualified to make this public exhibition,
and I have been told that those ladies who intended to dance minuets,
used to distinguish themselves from others by wearing a particular kind
of lappet on their head-dress.&nbsp; I have heard also of another curious
proof of the respect in which this dance was held.&nbsp; Gloves immaculately
clean were considered requisite for its due performance, while gloves
a little soiled were thought good enough for a country dance; and accordingly
some prudent ladies provided themselves with two pairs for their several
purposes.&nbsp; The minuet expired with the last century: but long after
it had ceased to be danced publicly it was taught to boys and girls,
in order to give them a graceful carriage.</p>
<p>Hornpipes, cotillons, and reels, were occasionally danced; but the
chief occupation of the evening was the interminable country dance,
in which all could join.&nbsp; This dance presented a great show of
enjoyment, but it was not without its peculiar troubles.&nbsp; The ladies
and gentlemen were ranged apart from each other in opposite rows, so
that the <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>facilities
for flirtation, or interesting intercourse, were not so great as might
have been desired by both parties.&nbsp; Much heart-burning and discontent
sometimes arose as to <i>who</i> should stand above <i>whom</i>, and
especially as to who was entitled to the high privilege of calling and
leading off the first dance: and no little indignation was felt at the
lower end of the room when any of the leading couples retired prematurely
from their duties, and did not condescend to dance up and down the whole
set.&nbsp; We may rejoice that these causes of irritation no longer
exist; and that if such feelings as jealousy, rivalry, and discontent
ever touch celestial bosoms in the modern ball-room they must arise
from different and more recondite sources.</p>
<p>I am tempted to add a little about the difference of personal habits.&nbsp;
It may be asserted as a general truth, that less was left to the charge
and discretion of servants, and more was done, or superintended, by
the masters and mistresses.&nbsp; With regard to the mistresses, it
is, I believe, generally understood, that at the time to which I refer,
a hundred years ago, they took a personal part in the higher branches
of cookery, as well as in the concoction of home-made wines, and distilling
of herbs for domestic medicines, which are nearly allied to the same
art.&nbsp; Ladies did not disdain to spin the thread of which the household
linen was woven.&nbsp; Some ladies liked to wash with their own hands
their choice china after breakfast or tea.&nbsp; In one of my earliest
child&rsquo;s <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>books,
a little girl, the daughter of a gentleman, is taught by her mother
to make her own bed before leaving her chamber.&nbsp; It was not so
much that they had not servants to do all these things for them, as
that they took an interest in such occupations.&nbsp; And it must be
borne in mind how many sources of interest enjoyed by this generation
were then closed, or very scantily opened to ladies.&nbsp; A very small
minority of them cared much for literature or science.&nbsp; Music was
not a very common, and drawing was a still rarer, accomplishment; needlework,
in some form or other, was their chief sedentary employment.</p>
<p>But I doubt whether the rising generation are equally aware how much
gentlemen also did for themselves in those times, and whether some things
that I can mention will not be a surprise to them.&nbsp; Two homely
proverbs were held in higher estimation in my early days than they are
now&mdash;&rsquo;The master&rsquo;s eye makes the horse fat;&rsquo;
and, &lsquo;If you would be well served, serve yourself.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Some gentlemen took pleasure in being their own gardeners, performing
all the scientific, and some of the manual, work themselves.&nbsp; Well-dressed
young men of my acquaintance, who had their coat from a London tailor,
would always brush their evening suit themselves, rather than entrust
it to the carelessness of a rough servant, and to the risks of dirt
and grease in the kitchen; for in those days servants&rsquo; halls were
not common in the houses of the clergy <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>and
the smaller country gentry.&nbsp; It was quite natural that Catherine
Morland should have contrasted the magnificence of the offices at Northanger
Abbey with the few shapeless pantries in her father&rsquo;s parsonage.&nbsp;
A young man who expected to have his things packed or unpacked for him
by a servant, when he travelled, would have been thought exceptionally
fine, or exceptionally lazy.&nbsp; When my uncle undertook to teach
me to shoot, his first lesson was how to clean my own gun.&nbsp; It
was thought meritorious on the evening of a hunting day, to turn out
after dinner, lanthorn in hand, and visit the stable, to ascertain that
the horse had been well cared for.&nbsp; This was of the more importance,
because, previous to the introduction of clipping, about the year 1820,
it was a difficult and tedious work to make a long-coated hunter dry
and comfortable, and was often very imperfectly done.&nbsp; Of course,
such things were not practised by those who had gamekeepers, and stud-grooms,
and plenty of well-trained servants; but they were practised by many
who were unequivocally gentlemen, and whose grandsons, occupying the
same position in life, may perhaps be astonished at being told that
&lsquo;<i>such things were</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I have drawn pictures for which my own experience, or what I heard
from others in my youth, have supplied the materials.&nbsp; Of course,
they cannot be universally applicable.&nbsp; Such details varied in
various circles, and were changed very gradually; <!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>nor
can I pretend to tell how much of what I have said is descriptive of
the family life at Steventon in Jane Austen&rsquo;s youth.&nbsp; I am
sure that the ladies there had nothing to do with the mysteries of the
stew-pot or the preserving-pan; but it is probable that their way of
life differed a little from ours, and would have appeared to us more
homely.&nbsp; It may be that useful articles, which would not now be
produced in drawing-rooms, were hemmed, and marked, and darned in the
old-fashioned parlour.&nbsp; But all this concerned only the outer life;
there was as much cultivation and refinement of mind as now, with probably
more studied courtesy and ceremony of manner to visitors; whilst certainly
in that family literary pursuits were not neglected.</p>
<p>I remember to have heard of only two little things different from
modern customs.&nbsp; One was, that on hunting mornings the young men
usually took their hasty breakfast in the kitchen.&nbsp; The early hour
at which hounds then met may account for this; and probably the custom
began, if it did not end, when they were boys; for they hunted at an
early age, in a scrambling sort of way, upon any pony or donkey that
they could procure, or, in default of such luxuries, on foot.&nbsp;
I have been told that Sir Francis Austen, when seven years old, bought
on his own account, it must be supposed with his father&rsquo;s permission,
a pony for a guinea and a half; and after riding him with great success
for two seasons, sold him for a guinea more.&nbsp; One <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>may
wonder how the child could have so much money, and how the animal could
have been obtained for so little.&nbsp; The same authority informs me
that his first cloth suit was made from a scarlet habit, which, according
to the fashion of the times, had been his mother&rsquo;s usual morning
dress.&nbsp; If all this is true, the future admiral of the British
Fleet must have cut a conspicuous figure in the hunting-field.&nbsp;
The other peculiarity was that, when the roads were dirty, the sisters
took long walks in pattens.&nbsp; This defence against wet and dirt
is now seldom seen.&nbsp; The few that remain are banished from good
society, and employed only in menial work; but a hundred and fifty years
ago they were celebrated in poetry, and considered so clever a contrivance
that Gay, in his &lsquo;Trivia,&rsquo; ascribes the invention to a god
stimulated by his passion for a mortal damsel, and derives the name
&lsquo;Patten&rsquo; from &lsquo;Patty.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>The patten now supports each frugal dame,<br />
Which from the blue-eyed Patty takes the name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But mortal damsels have long ago discarded the clumsy implement.&nbsp;
First it dropped its iron ring and became a clog; afterwards it was
fined down into the pliant galoshe&mdash;lighter to wear and more effectual
to protect&mdash;a no less manifest instance of gradual improvement
than Cowper indicates when he traces through eighty lines of poetry
his &lsquo;accomplished sofa&rsquo; back to the original three-legged
stool.</p>
<p>As an illustration of the purposes which a patten was intended to
serve, I add the following epigram, <!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>written
by Jane Austen&rsquo;s uncle, Mr. Leigh Perrot, on reading in a newspaper
the marriage of Captain Foote to Miss Patten:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Through the rough paths of life, with a patten your guard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May you safely and pleasantly jog;<br />
May the knot never slip, nor the ring press too hard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor the <i>Foot</i> find the <i>Patten</i> a clog.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the time when Jane Austen lived at Steventon, a work was carried
on in the neighbouring cottages which ought to be recorded, because
it has long ceased to exist.</p>
<p>Up to the beginning of the present century, poor women found profitable
employment in spinning flax or wool.&nbsp; This was a better occupation
for them than straw plaiting, inasmuch as it was carried on at the family
hearth, and did not admit of gadding and gossiping about the village.&nbsp;
The implement used was a long narrow machine of wood, raised on legs,
furnished at one end with a large wheel, and at the other with a spindle
on which the flax or wool was loosely wrapped, connected together by
a loop of string.&nbsp; One hand turned the wheel, while the other formed
the thread.&nbsp; The outstretched arms, the advanced foot, the sway
of the whole figure backwards and forwards, produced picturesque attitudes,
and displayed whatever of grace or beauty the work-woman might possess.
<a name="citation41"></a><a href="#footnote41">{41}</a>&nbsp; Some ladies
were fond of spinning, but they worked in a quieter manner, sitting
at a neat little machine <!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>of
varnished wood, like Tunbridge ware, generally turned by the foot, with
a basin of water at hand to supply the moisture required for forming
the thread, which the cottager took by a more direct and natural process
from her own mouth.&nbsp; I remember two such elegant little wheels
in our own family.</p>
<p>It may be observed that this hand-spinning is the most primitive
of female accomplishments, and can be traced back to the earliest times.&nbsp;
Ballad poetry and fairy tales are full of allusions to it.&nbsp; The
term &lsquo;spinster&rsquo; still testifies to its having been the ordinary
employment of the English young woman.&nbsp; It was the labour assigned
to the ejected nuns by the rough earl who said, &lsquo;Go spin, ye jades,
go spin.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was the employment at which Roman matrons and
Grecian princesses presided amongst their handmaids.&nbsp; Heathen mythology
celebrated it in the three Fates spinning and measuring out the thread
of human life.&nbsp; Holy Scripture honours it in those &lsquo;wise-hearted
women&rsquo; who &lsquo;did spin with their hands, and brought that
which they had spun&rsquo; for the construction of the Tabernacle in
the wilderness: and an old English proverb carries it still farther
back to the time &lsquo;when Adam delved and Eve span.&rsquo;&nbsp;
But, at last, this time-honoured domestic manufacture is quite extinct
amongst us&mdash;crushed by the power of steam, overborne by a countless
host of spinning jennies, and I can only just remember some of its last
struggles for existence in the Steventon cottages.</p>

III.</h2>
<p><i>Early Compositions&mdash;Friends at Ashe&mdash;A very old Letter&mdash;Lines
on the Death of Mrs. Lefroy&mdash;Observations on Jane Austen&rsquo;s
Letter-writing&mdash;Letters</i>.</p>
<p>I know little of Jane Austen&rsquo;s childhood.&nbsp; Her mother
followed a custom, not unusual in those days, though it seems strange
to us, of putting out her babies to be nursed in a cottage in the village.&nbsp;
The infant was daily visited by one or both of its parents, and frequently
brought to them at the parsonage, but the cottage was its home, and
must have remained so till it was old enough to run about and talk;
for I know that one of them, in after life, used to speak of his foster
mother as &lsquo;Movie,&rsquo; the name by which he had called her in
his infancy.&nbsp; It may be that the contrast between the parsonage
house and the best class of cottages was not quite so extreme then as
it would be now, that the one was somewhat less luxurious, and the other
less squalid.&nbsp; It would certainly seem from the results that it
was a wholesome and invigorating system, for the children were all strong
and healthy.&nbsp; Jane was probably treated like the rest in this respect.&nbsp;
In childhood every available opportunity of instruction was made use
of.&nbsp; According to the ideas of the time, she was well educated,
though not highly <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>accomplished,
and she certainly enjoyed that important element of mental training,
associating at home with persons of cultivated intellect.&nbsp; It cannot
be doubted that her early years were bright and happy, living, as she
did, with indulgent parents, in a cheerful home, not without agreeable
variety of society.&nbsp; To these sources of enjoyment must be added
the first stirrings of talent within her, and the absorbing interest
of original composition.&nbsp; It is impossible to say at how early
an age she began to write.&nbsp; There are copy books extant containing
tales some of which must have been composed while she was a young girl,
as they had amounted to a considerable number by the time she was sixteen.&nbsp;
Her earliest stories are of a slight and flimsy texture, and are generally
intended to be nonsensical, but the nonsense has much spirit in it.&nbsp;
They are usually preceded by a dedication of mock solemnity to some
one of her family.&nbsp; It would seem that the grandiloquent dedications
prevalent in those days had not escaped her youthful penetration.&nbsp;
Perhaps the most characteristic feature in these early productions is
that, however puerile the matter, they are always composed in pure simple
English, quite free from the over-ornamented style which might be expected
from so young a writer.&nbsp; One of her juvenile effusions is given,
as a specimen of the kind of transitory amusement which Jane was continually
supplying to the family party.</p>

<p>END OF THE FIRST ACT.</p>
<p>FINIS.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Her own mature opinion of the desirableness of such an early habit
of composition is given in the following words of a niece:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As I grew older, my aunt would talk to me more seriously of
my reading and my amusements.&nbsp; I had taken early to writing verses
and stories, and I am sorry to think how I troubled her with reading
them.&nbsp; She was very kind about it, and always had some praise to
bestow, but at last she warned me against spending too much time upon
them.&nbsp; She said&mdash;how well I recollect it!&mdash;that she knew
writing stories was a great amusement, and <i>she</i> thought a harmless
one, though many people, she was aware, thought otherwise; but that
at my age it would be bad for me to be much taken up with my own compositions.&nbsp;
Later still&mdash;it was after she had gone to Winchester&mdash;she
sent me a message to this effect, that if I would take her advice I
should cease writing till I was sixteen; that she had herself often
wished she had read more, and written less in the corresponding years
of her own life.&rsquo;&nbsp; As this niece was only twelve years old
at the time of her aunt&rsquo;s death, these words seem to imply that
the juvenile tales to which <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>I
have referred had, some of them at least, been written in her childhood.</p>
<p>But between these childish effusions, and the composition of her
living works, there intervened another stage of her progress, during
which she produced some stories, not without merit, but which she never
considered worthy of publication.&nbsp; During this preparatory period
her mind seems to have been working in a very different direction from
that into which it ultimately settled.&nbsp; Instead of presenting faithful
copies of nature, these tales were generally burlesques, ridiculing
the improbable events and exaggerated sentiments which she had met with
in sundry silly romances.&nbsp; Something of this fancy is to be found
in &lsquo;Northanger Abbey,&rsquo; but she soon left it far behind in
her subsequent course.&nbsp; It would seem as if she were first taking
note of all the faults to be avoided, and curiously considering how
she ought <i>not</i> to write before she attempted to put forth her
strength in the right direction.&nbsp; The family have, rightly, I think,
declined to let these early works be published.&nbsp; Mr. Shortreed
observed very pithily of Walter Scott&rsquo;s early rambles on the borders,
&lsquo;He was makin&rsquo; himsell a&rsquo; the time; but he didna ken,
may be, what he was about till years had passed.&nbsp; At first he thought
of little, I dare say, but the queerness and the fun.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
so, in a humbler way, Jane Austen was &lsquo;makin&rsquo; hersell,&rsquo;
little thinking of future fame, but caring only for &lsquo;the queerness
and the <!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>fun;&rsquo;
and it would be as unfair to expose this preliminary process to the
world, as it would be to display all that goes on behind the curtain
of the theatre before it is drawn up.</p>
<p>It was, however, at Steventon that the real foundations of her fame
were laid.&nbsp; There some of her most successful writing was composed
at such an early age as to make it surprising that so young a woman
could have acquired the insight into character, and the nice observation
of manners which they display.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pride and Prejudice,&rsquo;
which some consider the most brilliant of her novels, was the first
finished, if not the first begun.&nbsp; She began it in October 1796,
before she was twenty-one years old, and completed it in about ten months,
in August 1797.&nbsp; The title then intended for it was &lsquo;First
Impressions.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Sense and Sensibility&rsquo; was begun,
in its present form, immediately after the completion of the former,
in November 1797 but something similar in story and character had been
written earlier under the title of &lsquo;Elinor and Marianne;&rsquo;
and if, as is probable, a good deal of this earlier production was retained,
it must form the earliest specimen of her writing that has been given
to the world.&nbsp; &lsquo;Northanger Abbey,&rsquo; though not prepared
for the press till 1803, was certainly first composed in 1798.</p>
<p>Amongst the most valuable neighbours of the Austens were Mr. and
Mrs. Lefroy and their family.&nbsp; He was rector of the adjoining parish
of Ashe; she <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>was
sister to Sir Egerton Brydges, to whom we are indebted for the earliest
notice of Jane Austen that exists.&nbsp; In his autobiography, speaking
of his visits at Ashe, he writes thus: &lsquo;The nearest neighbours
of the Lefroys were the Austens of Steventon.&nbsp; I remember Jane
Austen, the novelist, as a little child.&nbsp; She was very intimate
with Mrs. Lefroy, and much encouraged by her.&nbsp; Her mother was a
Miss Leigh, whose paternal grandmother was sister to the first Duke
of Chandos.&nbsp; Mr. Austen was of a Kentish family, of which several
branches have been settled in the Weald of Kent, and some are still
remaining there.&nbsp; When I knew Jane Austen, I never suspected that
she was an authoress; but my eyes told me that she was fair and handsome,
slight and elegant, but with cheeks a little too full.&rsquo;&nbsp;
One may wish that Sir Egerton had dwelt rather longer on the subject
of these memoirs, instead of being drawn away by his extreme love for
genealogies to her great-grandmother and ancestors.&nbsp; That great-grandmother
however lives in the family records as Mary Brydges, a daughter of Lord
Chandos, married in Westminster Abbey to Theophilus Leigh of Addlestrop
in 1698.&nbsp; When a girl she had received a curious letter of advice
and reproof, written by her mother from Constantinople.&nbsp; Mary,
or &lsquo;Poll,&rsquo; was remaining in England with her grandmother,
Lady Bernard, who seems to have been wealthy and inclined to be too
indulgent to her granddaughter.&nbsp; This letter is given.&nbsp; Any
such authentic document, <!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>two
hundred years old, dealing with domestic details, must possess some
interest.&nbsp; This is remarkable, not only as a specimen of the homely
language in which ladies of rank then expressed themselves, but from
the sound sense which it contains.&nbsp; Forms of expression vary, but
good sense and right principles are the same in the nineteenth that
they were in the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>This letter shows that the wealth acquired by trade was already manifesting
itself in contrast with the straitened circumstances of some of the
nobility.&nbsp; Mary Brydges&rsquo;s &lsquo;poor ffather,&rsquo; in
whose household economy was necessary, was the King of England&rsquo;s
ambassador at Constantinople; the grandmother, who lived in &lsquo;great
plenty and splendour,&rsquo; was the widow of a Turkey merchant.&nbsp;
But then, as now, it would seem, rank had the power of attracting and
absorbing wealth.</p>
<p>At Ashe also Jane became acquainted with a member of the Lefroy family,
who was still living when I began these memoirs, a few months ago; the
Right Hon. Thomas Lefroy, late Chief Justice of Ireland.&nbsp; One must
look back more than seventy years to reach the time when these two bright
young persons were, for a short time, intimately acquainted with each
other, and then separated on their several courses, never to meet again;
both destined to attain some distinction in their different ways, one
to survive the other for more than half a century, yet in his extreme
old age to remember and speak, as he sometimes did, of his former companion,
as one to be much admired, and not easily forgotten by those who had
ever known her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lefroy herself was a remarkable person.&nbsp; Her <!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>rare
endowments of goodness, talents, graceful person, and engaging manners,
were sufficient to secure her a prominent place in any society into
which she was thrown; while her enthusiastic eagerness of disposition
rendered her especially attractive to a clever and lively girl.&nbsp;
She was killed by a fall from her horse on Jane&rsquo;s birthday, Dec.&nbsp;
16, 1804.&nbsp; The following lines to her memory were written by Jane
four years afterwards, when she was thirty-three years old.&nbsp; They
are given, not for their merits as poetry, but to show how deep and
lasting was the impression made by the elder friend on the mind of the
younger:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">To the Memory of Mrs. Lefroy</span>.</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>The day returns again, my natal day;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What mix&rsquo;d emotions in my mind arise!<br />
Beloved Friend; four years have passed away<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Since thou wert snatched for ever from our eyes.</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>The day commemorative of my birth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bestowing life, and light, and hope to me,<br />
Brings back the hour which was thy last on earth.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O! bitter pang of torturing memory!</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>Angelic woman! past my power to praise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In language meet thy talents, temper, mind,<br />
Thy solid worth, thy captivating grace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou friend and ornament of human kind.</p>
<p><!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>4.</p>
<p>But come, fond Fancy, thou indulgent power;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hope is desponding, chill, severe, to thee:<br />
Bless thou this little portion of an hour;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me behold her as she used to be.</p>
<p>5.</p>
<p>I see her here with all her smiles benign,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her looks of eager love, her accents sweet,<br />
That voice and countenance almost divine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Expression, harmony, alike complete.</p>
<p>6.</p>
<p>Listen!&nbsp; It is not sound alone, &rsquo;tis sense,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis genius, taste, and tenderness of soul:<br />
&rsquo;Tis genuine warmth of heart without pretence,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And purity of mind that crowns the whole.</p>
<p>7.</p>
<p>She speaks!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis eloquence, that grace of tongue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So rare, so lovely, never misapplied<br />
By her, to palliate vice, or deck a wrong:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She speaks and argues but on virtue&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>8.</p>
<p>Hers is the energy of soul sincere;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her Christian spirit, ignorant to feign,<br />
Seeks but to comfort, heal, enlighten, cheer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Confer a pleasure or prevent a pain.</p>
<p>9.</p>
<p>Can aught enhance such goodness? yes, to me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her partial favour from my earliest years<br />
Consummates all: ah! give me but to see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her smile of love!&nbsp; The vision disappears.</p>
<p><!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>10.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis past and gone.&nbsp; We meet no more below,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Short is the cheat of Fancy o&rsquo;er the tomb.<br />
Oh! might I hope to equal bliss to go,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To meet thee, angel, in thy future home.</p>
<p>11.</p>
<p>Fain would I feel an union with thy fate:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fain would I seek to draw an omen fair<br />
From this connection in our earthly date.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Indulge the harmless weakness.&nbsp; Reason, spare.</p>

<p>The loss of their first home is generally a great grief to young
persons of strong feeling and lively imagination; and Jane was exceedingly
unhappy when she was told that her father, now seventy years of age,
had determined to resign his duties to his eldest son, who was to be
his successor in the Rectory of Steventon, and to remove with his wife
and daughters to Bath.&nbsp; Jane had been absent from home when this
resolution was taken; and, as her father was always rapid both in forming
his resolutions and in acting on them, she had little time to reconcile
herself to the change.</p>

<p>A wish has sometimes been expressed that some of Jane Austen&rsquo;s
letters should be published.&nbsp; Some entire letters, and many extracts,
will be given in this memoir; but the reader must be warned not to expect
too much from them.&nbsp; With regard to accuracy of language indeed
every word of them might be printed without correction.&nbsp; The style
<!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>is
always clear, and generally animated, while a vein of humour continually
gleams through the whole; but the materials may be thought inferior
to the execution, for they treat only of the details of domestic life.&nbsp;
There is in them no notice of politics or public events; scarcely any
discussions on literature, or other subjects of general interest.&nbsp;
They may be said to resemble the nest which some little bird builds
of the materials nearest at hand, of the twigs and mosses supplied by
the tree in which it is placed; curiously constructed out of the simplest
matters.</p>
<p>Her letters have very seldom the date of the year, or the signature
of her christian name at full length; but it has been easy to ascertain
their dates, either from the post-mark, or from their contents.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The two following letters are the earliest that I have seen.&nbsp;
They were both written in November 1800; before the family removed from
Steventon.&nbsp; Some of the same circumstances are referred to in both.</p>
<p>The first is to her sister Cassandra, who was then staying with their
brother Edward at Godmersham Park, Kent:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Steventon, Saturday evening, Nov. 8th.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thank you for so speedy a return to my two last, and particularly
thank you for your anecdote of <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>Charlotte
Graham and her cousin, Harriet Bailey, which has very much amused both
my mother and myself.&nbsp; If you can learn anything farther of that
interesting affair, I hope you will mention it.&nbsp; I have two messages;
let me get rid of them, and then my paper will be my own.&nbsp; Mary
fully intended writing to you by Mr. Chute&rsquo;s frank, and only happened
entirely to forget it, but will write soon; and my father wishes Edward
to send him a memorandum of the price of the hops.&nbsp; The tables
are come, and give general contentment.&nbsp; I had not expected that
they would so perfectly suit the fancy of us all three, or that we should
so well agree in the disposition of them; but nothing except their own
surface can have been smoother.&nbsp; The two ends put together form
one constant table for everything, and the centre piece stands exceedingly
well under the glass, and holds a great deal most commodiously, without
looking awkwardly.&nbsp; They are both covered with green baize, and
send their best love.&nbsp; The Pembroke has got its destination by
the sideboard, and my mother has great delight in keeping her money
and papers locked up.&nbsp; The little table which used to stand there
has most conveniently taken itself off into the best bedroom; and we
are now in want only of the chiffonniere, which is neither finished
nor come.&nbsp; So much for that subject; I now come to another, of
a very different nature, as other subjects are very apt to be.&nbsp;
Earle Harwood has been again giving uneasiness to his family and talk
to the <!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>neighbourhood;
in the present instance, however, he is only unfortunate, and not in
fault.</p>
<p>&lsquo;About ten days ago, in cocking a pistol in the guard-room
at Marcau, he accidentally shot himself through the thigh.&nbsp; Two
young Scotch surgeons in the island were polite enough to propose taking
off the thigh at once, but to that he would not consent; and accordingly
in his wounded state was put on board a cutter and conveyed to Haslar
Hospital, at Gosport, where the bullet was extracted, and where he now
is, I hope, in a fair way of doing well.&nbsp; The surgeon of the hospital
wrote to the family on the occasion, and John Harwood went down to him
immediately, attended by James, <a name="citation62"></a><a href="#footnote62">{62}</a>
whose object in going was to be the means of bringing back the earliest
intelligence to Mr. and Mrs. Harwood, whose anxious sufferings, particularly
those of the latter, have of course been dreadful.&nbsp; They went down
on Tuesday, and James came back the next day, bringing such favourable
accounts as greatly to lessen the distress of the family at Deane, though
it will probably be a long while before Mrs. Harwood can be quite at
ease.&nbsp; <i>One</i> most material comfort, however, they have; the
assurance of its being really an accidental wound, which is not only
positively declared by Earle himself, but is likewise testified by the
particular direction of the bullet.&nbsp; Such a wound could not have
been received in a duel.&nbsp; At present he is going on very well,
but <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>the
surgeon will not declare him to be in no danger. <a name="citation63"></a><a href="#footnote63">{63}</a>&nbsp;
Mr. Heathcote met with a genteel little accident the other day in hunting.&nbsp;
He got off to lead his horse over a hedge, or a house, or something,
and his horse in his haste trod upon his leg, or rather ancle, I believe,
and it is not certain whether the small bone is not broke.&nbsp; Martha
has accepted Mary&rsquo;s invitation for Lord Portsmouth&rsquo;s ball.&nbsp;
He has not yet sent out his own invitations, but <i>that</i> does not
signify; Martha comes, and a ball there is to be.&nbsp; I think it will
be too early in her mother&rsquo;s absence for me to return with her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Sunday Evening</i>.&mdash;We have had a dreadful storm
of wind in the fore part of this day, which has done a great deal of
mischief among our trees.&nbsp; I was sitting alone in the dining-room
when an odd kind of crash startled me&mdash;in a moment afterwards it
was repeated.&nbsp; I then went to the window, which I reached just
in time to see the last of our two highly valued elms descend into the
Sweep!!!!&nbsp; The other, which had fallen, I suppose, in the first
crash, and which was the nearest to the pond, taking a more easterly
direction, sunk among our screen of chestnuts and firs, knocking down
one spruce-fir, beating off the head of another, and stripping the two
corner chestnuts of several branches in its fall.&nbsp; This is not
all.&nbsp; One large elm out of the two on the left-hand side as you
enter what I call the elm walk, was likewise blown <!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>down;
the maple bearing the weathercock was broke in two, and what I regret
more than all the rest is, that all the three elms which grew in Hall&rsquo;s
meadow, and gave such ornament to it, are gone; two were blown down,
and the other so much injured that it cannot stand.&nbsp; I am happy
to add, however, that no greater evil than the loss of trees has been
the consequence of the storm in this place, or in our immediate neighbourhood.&nbsp;
We grieve, therefore, in some comfort.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am yours ever,<br />
&lsquo;J. A.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next letter, written four days later than the former, was addressed
to Miss Lloyd, an intimate friend, whose sister (my mother) was married
to Jane&rsquo;s eldest brother:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Steventon, Wednesday evening, Nov. 12th.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Martha</span>,</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not receive your note yesterday till after Charlotte
had left Deane, or I would have sent my answer by her, instead of being
the means, as I now must be, of lessening the elegance of your new dress
for the Hurstbourne ball by the value of 3<i>d</i>.&nbsp; You are very
good in wishing to see me at Ibthorp so soon, and I am equally good
in wishing to come to you.&nbsp; I believe our merit in that respect
is much upon a par, our self-denial mutually strong.&nbsp; Having paid
this tribute of praise to the virtue of both, I <!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>shall
here have done with panegyric, and proceed to plain matter of fact.&nbsp;
In about a fortnight&rsquo;s time I hope to be with you.&nbsp; I have
two reasons for not being able to come before.&nbsp; I wish so to arrange
my visit as to spend some days with you after your mother&rsquo;s return.&nbsp;
In the 1st place, that I may have the pleasure of seeing her, and in
the 2nd, that I may have a better chance of bringing you back with me.&nbsp;
Your promise in my favour was not quite absolute, but if your will is
not perverse, you and I will do all in our power to overcome your scruples
of conscience.&nbsp; I hope we shall meet next week to talk all this
over, till we have tired ourselves with the very idea of my visit before
my visit begins.&nbsp; Our invitations for the 19th are arrived, and
very curiously are they worded. <a name="citation65"></a><a href="#footnote65">{65}</a>&nbsp;
Mary mentioned to you yesterday poor Earle&rsquo;s unfortunate accident,
I dare say.&nbsp; He does not seem to be going on very well.&nbsp; The
two or three last posts have brought less and less favourable accounts
of him.&nbsp; John Harwood has gone to Gosport again to-day.&nbsp; We
have two families of friends now who are in a most anxious state; for
though by a note from Catherine this morning there seems now to be a
revival of hope at Manydown, its continuance may <!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>be
too reasonably doubted.&nbsp; Mr. Heathcote, <a name="citation66a"></a><a href="#footnote66a">{66a}</a>
however, who has broken the small bone of his leg, is so good as to
be going on very well.&nbsp; It would be really too much to have three
people to care for.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You distress me cruelly by your request about books.&nbsp;
I cannot think of any to bring with me, nor have I any idea of our wanting
them.&nbsp; I come to you to be talked to, not to read or hear reading;
I can do that at home; and indeed I am now laying in a stock of intelligence
to pour out on you as my share of the conversation.&nbsp; I am reading
Henry&rsquo;s History of England, which I will repeat to you in any
manner you may prefer, either in a loose, desultory, unconnected stream,
or dividing my recital, as the historian divides it himself, into seven
parts:&mdash;The Civil and Military: Religion: Constitution: Learning
and Learned Men: Arts and Sciences: Commerce, Coins, and Shipping: and
Manners.&nbsp; So that for every evening in the week there will be a
different subject.&nbsp; The Friday&rsquo;s lot&mdash;Commerce, Coins,
and Shipping&mdash;you will find the least entertaining; but the next
evening&rsquo;s portion will make amends.&nbsp; With such a provision
on my part, if you will do yours by repeating the French Grammar, and
Mrs. Stent <a name="citation66b"></a><a href="#footnote66b">{66b}</a>
will now and then ejaculate some wonder about the cocks and <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>hens,
what can we want?&nbsp; Farewell for a short time.&nbsp; We all unite
in best love, and I am your very affectionate</p>
<p>&lsquo;J. A.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two next letters must have been written early in 1801, after
the removal from Steventon had been decided on, but before it had taken
place.&nbsp; They refer to the two brothers who were at sea, and give
some idea of a kind of anxieties and uncertainties to which sisters
are seldom subject in these days of peace, steamers, and electric telegraphs.&nbsp;
At that time ships were often windbound or becalmed, or driven wide
of their destination; and sometimes they had orders to alter their course
for some secret service; not to mention the chance of conflict with
a vessel of superior power&mdash;no improbable occurrence before the
battle of Trafalgar.&nbsp; Information about relatives on board men-of-war
was scarce and scanty, and often picked up by hearsay or chance means;
and every scrap of intelligence was proportionably valuable:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should not have thought it necessary to write to you so
soon, but for the arrival of a letter from Charles to myself.&nbsp;
It was written last Saturday from off the Start, and conveyed to Popham
Lane by Captain Boyle, on his way to Midgham.&nbsp; He came from Lisbon
in the &ldquo;Endymion.&rdquo;&nbsp; I will copy <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>Charles&rsquo;s
account of his conjectures about Frank: &ldquo;He has not seen my brother
lately, nor does he expect to find him arrived, as he met Captain Inglis
at Rhodes, going up to take command of the &lsquo;Petrel,&rsquo; as
he was coming down; but supposes he will arrive in less than a fortnight
from this time, in some ship which is expected to reach England about
that time with dispatches from Sir Ralph Abercrombie.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
event must show what sort of a conjuror Captain Boyle is.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Endymion&rdquo; has not been plagued with any more prizes.&nbsp;
Charles spent three pleasant days in Lisbon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They were very well satisfied with their royal passenger,
<a name="citation68"></a><a href="#footnote68">{68}</a> whom they found
jolly and affable, who talks of Lady Augusta as his wife, and seems
much attached to her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When this letter was written, the &ldquo;Endymion&rdquo; was
becalmed, but Charles hoped to reach Portsmouth by Monday or Tuesday.&nbsp;
He received my letter, communicating our plans, before he left England;
was much surprised, of course, but is quite reconciled to them, and
means to come to Steventon once more while Steventon is ours.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From a letter written later in the same year:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Charles has received 30<i>l</i>. for his share
of the privateer, and expects 10<i>l</i>. more; but of what avail is
it to take prizes if he lays out the produce in <!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>presents
to his sisters?&nbsp; He has been buying gold chains and topaze crosses
for us.&nbsp; He must be well scolded.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Endymion&rdquo;
has already received orders for taking troops to Egypt, which I should
not like at all if I did not trust to Charles being removed from her
somehow or other before she sails.&nbsp; He knows nothing of his own
destination, he says, but desires me to write directly, as the &ldquo;Endymion&rdquo;
will probably sail in three or four days.&nbsp; He will receive my yesterday&rsquo;s
letter, and I shall write again by this post to thank and reproach him.&nbsp;
We shall be unbearably fine.&rsquo;</p>

<h2><!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>CHAPTER
IV.</h2>
<p><i>Removal from Steventon&mdash;Residences at Bath and at Southampton&mdash;Settling
at Chawton</i>.</p>
<p>The family removed to Bath in the spring of 1801, where they resided
first at No. 4 Sydney Terrace, and afterwards in Green Park Buildings.&nbsp;
I do not know whether they were at all attracted to Bath by the circumstance
that Mrs. Austen&rsquo;s only brother, Mr. Leigh Perrot, spent part
of every year there.&nbsp; The name of Perrot, together with a small
estate at Northleigh in Oxfordshire, had been bequeathed to him by a
great uncle.&nbsp; I must devote a few sentences to this very old and
now extinct branch of the Perrot family; for one of the last survivors,
Jane Perrot, married to a Walker, was Jane Austen&rsquo;s great grandmother,
from whom she derived her Christian name.&nbsp; The Perrots were settled
in Pembrokeshire at least as early as the thirteenth century.&nbsp;
They were probably some of the settlers whom the policy of our Plantagenet
kings placed in that county, which thence acquired the name of &lsquo;England
beyond Wales,&rsquo; for the double purpose of keeping open a communication
with Ireland from Milford Haven, and of overawing the Welsh.&nbsp; One
of the family seems to have carried out this latter <!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>purpose
very vigorously; for it is recorded of him that he slew <i>twenty-six
men</i> of Kemaes, a district of Wales, and <i>one wolf</i>.&nbsp; The
manner in which the two kinds of game are classed together, and the
disproportion of numbers, are remarkable; but probably at that time
the wolves had been so closely killed down, that <i>lupicide</i> was
become a more rare and distinguished exploit than <i>homicide</i>.&nbsp;
The last of this family died about 1778, and their property was divided
between Leighs and Musgraves, the larger portion going to the latter.&nbsp;
Mr. Leigh Perrot pulled down the mansion, and sold the estate to the
Duke of Marlborough, and the name of these Perrots is now to be found
only on some monuments in the church of Northleigh.</p>
<p>Mr. Leigh Perrot was also one of several cousins to whom a life interest
in the Stoneleigh property in Warwickshire was left, after the extinction
of the earlier Leigh peerage, but he compromised his claim to the succession
in his lifetime.&nbsp; He married a niece of Sir Montague Cholmeley
of Lincolnshire.&nbsp; He was a man of considerable natural power, with
much of the wit of his uncle, the Master of Balliol, and wrote clever
epigrams and riddles, some of which, though without his name, found
their way into print; but he lived a very retired life, dividing his
time between Bath and his place in Berkshire called Scarlets.&nbsp;
Jane&rsquo;s letters from Bath make frequent mention of this uncle and
aunt.</p>
<p>The unfinished story, now published under the <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>title
of &lsquo;The Watsons,&rsquo; must have been written during the author&rsquo;s
residence in Bath.&nbsp; In the autumn of 1804 she spent some weeks
at Lyme, and became acquainted with the Cobb, which she afterwards made
memorable for the fall of Louisa Musgrove.&nbsp; In February 1805, her
father died at Bath, and was buried at Walcot Church.&nbsp; The widow
and daughters went into lodgings for a few months, and then removed
to Southampton.&nbsp; The only records that I can find about her during
those four years are the three following letters to her sister; one
from Lyme, the others from Bath.&nbsp; They shew that she went a good
deal into society, in a quiet way, chiefly with ladies; and that her
eyes were always open to minute traits of character in those with whom
she associated:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Extract from a letter from Jane Austen to her Sister</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Lyme, Friday, Sept. 14 (1804).</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,&mdash;I take
the first sheet of fine striped paper to thank you for your letter from
Weymouth, and express my hopes of your being at Ibthorp before this
time.&nbsp; I expect to hear that you reached it yesterday evening,
being able to get as far as Blandford on Wednesday.&nbsp; Your account
of Weymouth contains nothing which strikes me so forcibly as there being
no ice in the town.&nbsp; For every other vexation I was in some measure
prepared, and particularly for your disappointment in not seeing <!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>the
Royal Family go on board on Tuesday, having already heard from Mr. Crawford
that he had seen you in the very act of being too late.&nbsp; But for
there being no ice, what could prepare me!&nbsp; You found my letter
at Andover, I hope, yesterday, and have now for many hours been satisfied
that your kind anxiety on my behalf was as much thrown away as kind
anxiety usually is.&nbsp; I continue quite well; in proof of which I
have bathed again this morning.&nbsp; It was absolutely necessary that
I should have the little fever and indisposition which I had: it has
been all the fashion this week in Lyme.&nbsp; We are quite settled in
our lodgings by this time, as you may suppose, and everything goes on
in the usual order.&nbsp; The servants behave very well, and make no
difficulties, though nothing certainly can exceed the inconvenience
of the offices, except the general dirtiness of the house and furniture,
and all its inhabitants.&nbsp; I endeavour, as far as I can, to supply
your place, and be useful, and keep things in order.&nbsp; I detect
dirt in the water decanters, as fast as I can, and keep everything as
it was under your administration . . . .&nbsp; The ball last night was
pleasant, but not full for Thursday.&nbsp; My father staid contentedly
till half-past nine (we went a little after eight), and then walked
home with James and a lanthorn, though I believe the lanthorn was not
lit, as the moon was up; but sometimes this lanthorn may be a great
convenience to him.&nbsp; My mother and I staid about an hour later.&nbsp;
Nobody asked me the <!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>two
first dances; the two next I danced with Mr. Crawford, and had I chosen
to stay longer might have danced with Mr. Granville, Mrs. Granville&rsquo;s
son, whom my dear friend Miss A. introduced to me, or with a new odd-looking
man who had been eyeing me for some time, and at last, without any introduction,
asked me if I meant to dance again.&nbsp; I think he must be Irish by
his ease, and because I imagine him to belong to the hon<sup>bl</sup>
B.&rsquo;s, who are son, and son&rsquo;s wife of an Irish viscount,
bold queer-looking people, just fit to be quality at Lyme.&nbsp; I called
yesterday morning (ought it not in strict propriety to be termed yester-morning?)
on Miss A. and was introduced to her father and mother.&nbsp; Like other
young ladies she is considerably genteeler than her parents.&nbsp; Mrs.
A. sat darning a pair of stockings the whole of my visit.&nbsp; But
do not mention this at home, lest a warning should act as an example.&nbsp;
We afterwards walked together for an hour on the Cobb; she is very converseable
in a common way; I do not perceive wit or genius, but she has sense
and some degree of taste, and her manners are very engaging.&nbsp; She
seems to like people rather too easily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yours affect<sup>ly</sup>,<br />
&lsquo;J. A.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Letter from Jane Austen to her sister Cassandra at Ibthorp, alluding
to the sudden death of Mrs. Lloyd at that place:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>&lsquo;25
Gay Street (Bath), Monday,</p>
<p>April 8, 1805.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,&mdash;Here is
a day for you.&nbsp; Did Bath or Ibthorp ever see such an 8th of April?&nbsp;
It is March and April together; the glare of the one and the warmth
of the other.&nbsp; We do nothing but walk about.&nbsp; As far as your
means will admit, I hope you profit by such weather too.&nbsp; I dare
say you are already the better for change of place.&nbsp; We were out
again last night.&nbsp; Miss Irvine invited us, when I met her in the
Crescent, to drink tea with them, but I rather declined it, having no
idea that my mother would be disposed for another evening visit there
so soon; but when I gave her the message, I found her very well inclined
to go; and accordingly, on leaving Chapel, we walked to Lansdown.&nbsp;
This morning we have been to see Miss Chamberlaine look hot on horseback.&nbsp;
Seven years and four months ago we went to the same riding-house to
see Miss Lefroy&rsquo;s performance! <a name="citation75a"></a><a href="#footnote75a">{75a}</a>&nbsp;
What a different set are we now moving in!&nbsp; But seven years, I
suppose, are enough to change every pore of one&rsquo;s skin and every
feeling of one&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; We did not walk long in the Crescent
yesterday.&nbsp; It was hot and not crowded enough; so we went into
the field, and passed close by S. T. and Miss S. <a name="citation75b"></a><a href="#footnote75b">{75b}</a>
again.&nbsp; I have not yet seen her face, but neither her dress nor
air have anything of the dash or <!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>stylishness
which the Browns talked of; quite the contrary; indeed, her dress is
not even smart, and her appearance very quiet.&nbsp; Miss Irvine says
she is never speaking a word.&nbsp; Poor wretch; I am afraid she is
<i>en p&eacute;nitence</i>.&nbsp; Here has been that excellent Mrs.
Coulthart calling, while my mother was out, and I was believed to be
so.&nbsp; I always respected her, as a good-hearted friendly woman.&nbsp;
And the Browns have been here; I find their affidavits on the table.&nbsp;
The &ldquo;Ambuscade&rdquo; reached Gibraltar on the 9th of March, and
found all well; so say the papers.&nbsp; We have had no letters from
anybody, but we expect to hear from Edward to-morrow, and from you soon
afterwards.&nbsp; How happy they are at Godmersham now!&nbsp; I shall
be very glad of a letter from Ibthorp, that I may know how you all are,
but particularly yourself.&nbsp; This is nice weather for Mrs. J.&nbsp;
Austen&rsquo;s going to Speen, and I hope she will have a pleasant visit
there.&nbsp; I expect a prodigious account of the christening dinner;
perhaps it brought you at last into the company of Miss Dundas again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;I received your letter last night, and
wish it may be soon followed by another to say that all is over; but
I cannot help thinking that nature will struggle again, and produce
a revival.&nbsp; Poor woman!&nbsp; May her end be peaceful and easy
as the exit we have witnessed!&nbsp; And I dare say it will.&nbsp; If
there is no revival, suffering must be all over; even the consciousness
of existence, I suppose, was gone <!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>when
you wrote.&nbsp; The nonsense I have been writing in this and in my
last letter seems out of place at such a time, but I will not mind it;
it will do you no harm, and nobody else will be attacked by it.&nbsp;
I am heartily glad that you can speak so comfortably of your own health
and looks, though I can scarcely comprehend the latter being really
approved.&nbsp; Could travelling fifty miles produce such an immediate
change?&nbsp; You were looking very poorly here, and everybody seemed
sensible of it.&nbsp; Is there a charm in a hack postchaise?&nbsp; But
if there were, Mrs. Craven&rsquo;s carriage might have undone it all.&nbsp;
I am much obliged to you for the time and trouble you have bestowed
on Mary&rsquo;s cap, and am glad it pleases her; but it will prove a
useless gift at present, I suppose.&nbsp; Will not she leave Ibthorp
on her mother&rsquo;s death?&nbsp; As a companion you are all that Martha
can be supposed to want, and in that light, under these circumstances,
your visit will indeed have been well timed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;I was not able to go on yesterday;
all my wit and leisure were bestowed on letters to Charles and Henry.&nbsp;
To the former I wrote in consequence of my mother&rsquo;s having seen
in the papers that the &ldquo;Urania&rdquo; was waiting at Portsmouth
for the convoy for Halifax.&nbsp; This is nice, as it is only three
weeks ago that you wrote by the &ldquo;Camilla.&rdquo;&nbsp; I wrote
to Henry because I had a letter from him in which he desired to hear
from me very soon.&nbsp; His to me was most affectionate and kind, as
well as <!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>entertaining;
there is no merit to him in <i>that</i>; he cannot help being amusing.&nbsp;
He offers to meet us on the sea coast, if the plan of which Edward gave
him some hint takes place.&nbsp; Will not this be making the execution
of such a plan more desirable and delightful than ever?&nbsp; He talks
of the rambles we took together last summer with pleasing affection.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yours ever,<br />
&lsquo;J. A.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>From the same to the same</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Gay St. Sunday Evening,<br />
&lsquo;April 21 (1805).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,&mdash;I am much obliged
to you for writing to me again so soon; your letter yesterday was quite
an unexpected pleasure.&nbsp; Poor Mrs. Stent! it has been her lot to
be always in the way; but we must be merciful, for perhaps in time we
may come to be Mrs. Stents ourselves, unequal to anything, and unwelcome
to everybody . . . .&nbsp; My morning engagement was with the Cookes,
and our party consisted of George and Mary, a Mr. L., Miss B., who had
been with us at the concert, and the youngest Miss W.&nbsp; Not Julia;
we have done with her; she is very ill; but Mary.&nbsp; Mary W.&rsquo;s
turn is actually come to be grown up, and have a fine complexion, and
wear great square muslin shawls.&nbsp; I have not expressly enumerated
myself among the party, but there I was, and my cousin George was very
kind, and talked sense to me every now and <!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>then,
in the intervals of his more animated fooleries with Miss B., who is
very young, and rather handsome, and whose gracious manners, ready wit,
and solid remarks, put me somewhat in mind of my old acquaintance L.
L.&nbsp; There was a monstrous deal of stupid quizzing and common-place
nonsense talked, but scarcely any wit; all that bordered on it or on
sense came from my cousin George, whom altogether I like very well.&nbsp;
Mr. B. seems nothing more than a tall young man.&nbsp; My evening engagement
and walk was with Miss A., who had called on me the day before, and
gently upbraided me in her turn with a change of manners to her since
she had been in Bath, or at least of late.&nbsp; Unlucky me! that my
notice should be of such consequence, and my manners so bad!&nbsp; She
was so well disposed, and so reasonable, that I soon forgave her, and
made this engagement with her in proof of it.&nbsp; She is really an
agreeable girl, so I think I may like her; and her great want of a companion
at home, which may well make any tolerable acquaintance important to
her, gives her another claim on my attention.&nbsp; I shall endeavour
as much as possible to keep my intimacies in their proper place, and
prevent their clashing.&nbsp; Among so many friends, it will be well
if I do not get into a scrape; and now here is Miss Blashford come.&nbsp;
I should have gone distracted if the Bullers had staid . . . .&nbsp;
When I tell you I have been visiting a countess this morning, you will
immediately, with great justice, but no <!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>truth,
guess it to be Lady Roden.&nbsp; No: it is Lady Leven, the mother of
Lord Balgonie.&nbsp; On receiving a message from Lord and Lady Leven
through the Mackays, declaring their intention of waiting on us, we
thought it right to go to them.&nbsp; I hope we have not done too much,
but the friends and admirers of Charles must be attended to.&nbsp; They
seem very reasonable, good sort of people, very civil, and full of his
praise. <a name="citation80"></a><a href="#footnote80">{80}</a>&nbsp;
We were shewn at first into an empty drawing-room, and presently in
came his lordship, not knowing who we were, to apologise for the servant&rsquo;s
mistake, and to say himself what was untrue, that Lady Leven was not
within.&nbsp; He is a tall gentlemanlike looking man, with spectacles,
and rather deaf.&nbsp; After sitting with him ten minutes we walked
away; but Lady Leven coming out of the dining parlour as we passed the
door, we were obliged to attend her back to it, and pay our visit over
again.&nbsp; She is a stout woman, with a very handsome face.&nbsp;
By this means we had the pleasure of hearing Charles&rsquo;s praises
twice over.&nbsp; They think themselves excessively obliged to him,
and estimate him so highly as to wish Lord Balgonie, when he is quite
recovered, to go out to him.&nbsp; There is a pretty little Lady Marianne
of the party, to be shaken hands with, and asked if she remembered Mr.
Austen: . . .</p>
<p><!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>&lsquo;I
shall write to Charles by the next packet, unless you tell me in the
meantime of your intending to do it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Believe me, if you chuse,<br />
&lsquo;Y<sup>r</sup> aff<sup>te</sup> Sister.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jane did not estimate too highly the &lsquo;Cousin George&rsquo;
mentioned in the foregoing letter; who might easily have been superior
in sense and wit to the rest of the party.&nbsp; He was the Rev. George
Leigh Cooke, long known and respected at Oxford, where he held important
offices, and had the privilege of helping to form the minds of men more
eminent than himself.&nbsp; As Tutor in Corpus Christi College, he became
instructor to some of the most distinguished undergraduates of that
time: amongst others to Dr. Arnold, the Rev. John Keble, and Sir John
Coleridge.&nbsp; The latter has mentioned him in terms of affectionate
regard, both in his Memoir of Keble, and in a letter which appears in
Dean Stanley&rsquo;s &lsquo;Life of Arnold.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Cooke was
also an impressive preacher of earnest awakening sermons.&nbsp; I remember
to have heard it observed by some of my undergraduate friends that,
after all, there was more good to be got from George Cooke&rsquo;s plain
sermons than from much of the more laboured oratory of the University
pulpit.&nbsp; He was frequently Examiner in the schools, and occupied
the chair of the Sedleian Professor of Natural Philosophy, from 1810
to 1853.</p>
<p><!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>Before
the end of 1805, the little family party removed to Southampton.&nbsp;
They resided in a commodious old-fashioned house in a corner of Castle
Square.</p>
<p>I have no letters of my aunt, nor any other record of her, during
her four years&rsquo; residence at Southampton; and though I now began
to know, and, what was the same thing, to love her myself, yet my observations
were only those of a young boy, and were not capable of penetrating
her character, or estimating her powers.&nbsp; I have, however, a lively
recollection of some local circumstances at Southampton, and as they
refer chiefly to things which have been long ago swept away, I will
record them.&nbsp; My grandmother&rsquo;s house had a pleasant garden,
bounded on one side by the old city walls; the top of this wall was
sufficiently wide to afford a pleasant walk, with an extensive view,
easily accessible to ladies by steps.&nbsp; This must have been a part
of the identical walls which witnessed the embarkation of Henry V. before
the battle of Agincourt, and the detection of the conspiracy of Cambridge,
Scroop, and Grey, which Shakspeare has made so picturesque; when, according
to the chorus in Henry V., the citizens saw</p>
<blockquote><p>The well-appointed King at Hampton Pier<br />
Embark his royalty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Among the records of the town of Southampton, they have a minute
and authentic account, drawn <!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>up
at that time, of the encampment of Henry V. near the town, before his
embarkment for France.&nbsp; It is remarkable that the place where the
army was encamped, then a low level plain, is now entirely covered by
the sea, and is called Westport. <a name="citation83"></a><a href="#footnote83">{83}</a>&nbsp;
At that time Castle Square was occupied by a fantastic edifice, too
large for the space in which it stood, though too small to accord well
with its castellated style, erected by the second Marquis of Lansdowne,
half-brother to the well-known statesman, who succeeded him in the title.&nbsp;
The Marchioness had a light phaeton, drawn by six, and sometimes by
eight little ponies, each pair decreasing in size, and becoming lighter
in colour, through all the grades of dark brown, light brown, bay, and
chestnut, as it was placed farther away from the carriage.&nbsp; The
two leading pairs were managed by two boyish postilions, the two pairs
nearest to the carriage were driven in hand.&nbsp; It was a delight
to me to look down from the window and see this fairy equipage put together;
for the premises of this castle were so contracted that the whole process
went on in the little space that remained of the open square.&nbsp;
Like other fairy works, however, it all proved evanescent.&nbsp; Not
only carriage and ponies, but castle itself, soon vanished away, &lsquo;like
the baseless fabric of a vision.&rsquo;&nbsp; On the death of the Marquis
in 1809, the castle was pulled down.&nbsp; Few probably remember its
existence; and any one who might <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>visit
the place now would wonder how it ever could have stood there.</p>
<p>In 1809 Mr. Knight was able to offer his mother the choice of two
houses on his property; one near his usual residence at Godmersham Park
in Kent; the other near Chawton House, his occasional residence in Hampshire.&nbsp;
The latter was chosen; and in that year the mother and daughters, together
with Miss Lloyd, a near connection who lived with them, settled themselves
at Chawton Cottage.</p>
<p>Chawton may be called the <i>second</i>, as well as the <i>last</i>
home of Jane Austen; for during the temporary residences of the party
at Bath and Southampton she was only a sojourner in a strange land;
but here she found a real home amongst her own people.&nbsp; It so happened
that during her residence at Chawton circumstances brought several of
her brothers and their families within easy distance of the house.&nbsp;
Chawton must also be considered the place most closely connected with
her career as a writer; for there it was that, in the maturity of her
mind, she either wrote or rearranged, and prepared for publication the
books by which she has become known to the world.&nbsp; This was the
home where, after a few years, while still in the prime of life, she
began to droop and wither away, and which she left only in the last
stage of her illness, yielding to the persuasion of friends hoping against
hope.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/chawtonchurch.jpg">
<img alt="Chawton Church" src="images/chawtonchurch.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>This house stood in the village of Chawton, about a mile from Alton,
on the right hand side, just where <!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>the
road to Winchester branches off from that to Gosport.&nbsp; It was so
close to the road that the front door opened upon it; while a very narrow
enclosure, paled in on each side, protected the building from danger
of collision with any runaway vehicle.&nbsp; I believe it had been originally
built for an inn, for which purpose it was certainly well situated.&nbsp;
Afterwards it had been occupied by Mr. Knight&rsquo;s steward; but by
some additions to the house, and some judicious planting and skreening,
it was made a pleasant and commodious abode.&nbsp; Mr. Knight was experienced
and adroit at such arrangements, and this was a labour of love to him.&nbsp;
A good-sized entrance and two sitting-rooms made the length of the house,
all intended originally to look upon the road, but the large drawing-room
window was blocked up and turned into a book-case, and another opened
at the side which gave to view only turf and trees, as a high wooden
fence and hornbeam hedge shut out the Winchester road, which skirted
the whole length of the little domain.&nbsp; Trees were planted each
side to form a shrubbery walk, carried round the enclosure, which gave
a sufficient space for ladies&rsquo; exercise.&nbsp; There was a pleasant
irregular mixture of hedgerow, and gravel walk, and orchard, and long
grass for mowing, arising from two or three little enclosures having
been thrown together.&nbsp; The house itself was quite as good as the
generality of parsonage-houses then were, and much in the same style;
and was capable of receiving other members <!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>of
the family as frequent visitors.&nbsp; It was sufficiently well furnished;
everything inside and out was kept in good repair, and it was altogether
a comfortable and ladylike establishment, though the means which supported
it were not large.</p>
<p>I give this description because some interest is generally taken
in the residence of a popular writer.&nbsp; Cowper&rsquo;s unattractive
house in the street of Olney has been pointed out to visitors, and has
even attained the honour of an engraving in Southey&rsquo;s edition
of his works: but I cannot recommend any admirer of Jane Austen to undertake
a pilgrimage to this spot.&nbsp; The building indeed still stands, but
it has lost all that gave it its character.&nbsp; After the death of
Mrs. Cassandra Austen, in 1845, it was divided into tenements for labourers,
and the grounds reverted to ordinary uses.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><i>Description of Jane Austen&rsquo;s person, character, and tastes</i>.</p>
<p>As my memoir has now reached the period when I saw a great deal of
my aunt, and was old enough to understand something of her value, I
will here attempt a description of her person, mind, and habits.&nbsp;
In person she was very attractive; her figure was rather tall and slender,
her step light and firm, and her whole appearance expressive of health
and animation.&nbsp; In complexion she was a clear brunette with a rich
colour; she had full round cheeks, with mouth and nose small and well
formed, bright hazel eyes, and brown hair forming natural curls close
round her face.&nbsp; If not so regularly handsome as her sister, yet
her countenance had a peculiar charm of its own to the eyes of most
beholders.&nbsp; At the time of which I am now writing, she never was
seen, either morning or evening, without a cap; I believe that she and
her sister were generally thought to have taken to the garb of middle
age earlier than their years or their looks required; and that, though
remarkably neat in their dress as in all their ways, they were scarcely
sufficiently regardful of the fashionable, or the becoming.</p>
<p>She was not highly accomplished according to the present standard.&nbsp;
Her sister drew well, and it is <!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>from
a drawing of hers that the likeness prefixed to this volume has been
taken.&nbsp; Jane herself was fond of music, and had a sweet voice,
both in singing and in conversation; in her youth she had received some
instruction on the pianoforte; and at Chawton she practised daily, chiefly
before breakfast.&nbsp; I believe she did so partly that she might not
disturb the rest of the party who were less fond of music.&nbsp; In
the evening she would sometimes sing, to her own accompaniment, some
simple old songs, the words and airs of which, now never heard, still
linger in my memory.</p>
<p>She read French with facility, and knew something of Italian.&nbsp;
In those days German was no more thought of than Hindostanee, as part
of a lady&rsquo;s education.&nbsp; In history she followed the old guides&mdash;Goldsmith,
Hume, and Robertson.&nbsp; Critical enquiry into the usually received
statements of the old historians was scarcely begun.&nbsp; The history
of the early kings of Rome had not yet been dissolved into legend.&nbsp;
Historic characters lay before the reader&rsquo;s eyes in broad light
or shade, not much broken up by details.&nbsp; The virtues of King Henry
VIII. were yet undiscovered, nor had much light been thrown on the inconsistencies
of Queen Elizabeth; the one was held to be an unmitigated tyrant, and
an embodied Blue Beard; the other a perfect model of wisdom and policy.&nbsp;
Jane, when a girl, had strong political opinions, especially about the
affairs of the sixteenth and seventeenth <!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>centuries.&nbsp;
She was a vehement defender of Charles I. and his grandmother Mary;
but I think it was rather from an impulse of feeling than from any enquiry
into the evidences by which they must be condemned or acquitted.&nbsp;
As she grew up, the politics of the day occupied very little of her
attention, but she probably shared the feeling of moderate Toryism which
prevailed in her family.&nbsp; She was well acquainted with the old
periodicals from the &lsquo;Spectator&rsquo; downwards.&nbsp; Her knowledge
of Richardson&rsquo;s works was such as no one is likely again to acquire,
now that the multitude and the merits of our light literature have called
off the attention of readers from that great master.&nbsp; Every circumstance
narrated in Sir Charles Grandison, all that was ever said or done in
the cedar parlour, was familiar to her; and the wedding days of Lady
L. and Lady G. were as well remembered as if they had been living friends.&nbsp;
Amongst her favourite writers, Johnson in prose, Crabbe in verse, and
Cowper in both, stood high.&nbsp; It is well that the native good taste
of herself and of those with whom she lived, saved her from the snare
into which a sister novelist had fallen, of imitating the grandiloquent
style of Johnson.&nbsp; She thoroughly enjoyed Crabbe; perhaps on account
of a certain resemblance to herself in minute and highly finished detail;
and would sometimes say, in jest, that, if she ever married at all,
she could fancy being Mrs. Crabbe; looking on the author quite as an
abstract idea, and ignorant <!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>and
regardless what manner of man he might be.&nbsp; Scott&rsquo;s poetry
gave her great pleasure; she did not live to make much acquaintance
with his novels.&nbsp; Only three of them were published before her
death; but it will be seen by the following extract from one of her
letters, that she was quite prepared to admit the merits of &lsquo;Waverley&rsquo;;
and it is remarkable that, living, as she did, far apart from the gossip
of the literary world, she should even then have spoken so confidently
of his being the author of it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Walter Scott has no business to write novels;
especially good ones.&nbsp; It is not fair.&nbsp; He has fame and profit
enough as a poet, and ought not to be taking the bread out of other
people&rsquo;s mouths.&nbsp; I do not mean to like &ldquo;Waverley,&rdquo;
if I can help it, but I fear I must.&nbsp; I am quite determined, however,
not to be pleased with Mrs. ---&rsquo;s, should I ever meet with it,
which I hope I may not.&nbsp; I think I can be stout against anything
written by her.&nbsp; I have made up my mind to like no novels really,
but Miss Edgeworth&rsquo;s, E.&rsquo;s, and my own.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was not, however, what she <i>knew</i>, but what she <i>was</i>,
that distinguished her from others.&nbsp; I cannot better describe the
fascination which she exercised over children than by quoting the words
of two of her nieces.&nbsp; One says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;As a very little girl I was always creeping up
to aunt Jane, and following her whenever I could, in the house and out
of it.&nbsp; I might not have remembered this but for the recollection
of my mother&rsquo;s <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>telling
me privately, that I must not be troublesome to my aunt.&nbsp; Her first
charm to children was great sweetness of manner.&nbsp; She seemed to
love you, and you loved her in return.&nbsp; This, as well as I can
now recollect, was what I felt in my early days, before I was old enough
to be amused by her cleverness.&nbsp; But soon came the delight of her
playful talk.&nbsp; She could make everything amusing to a child.&nbsp;
Then, as I got older, when cousins came to share the entertainment,
she would tell us the most delightful stories, chiefly of Fairyland,
and her fairies had all characters of their own.&nbsp; The tale was
invented, I am sure, at the moment, and was continued for two or three
days, if occasion served.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again: &lsquo;When staying at Chawton, with two of her other nieces,
we often had amusements in which my aunt was very helpful.&nbsp; She
was the one to whom we always looked for help.&nbsp; She would furnish
us with what we wanted from her wardrobe; and she would be the entertaining
visitor in our make-believe house.&nbsp; She amused us in various ways.&nbsp;
Once, I remember, in giving a conversation as between myself and my
two cousins, supposing we were all grown up, the day after a ball.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Very similar is the testimony of another niece:&mdash;&lsquo;Aunt
Jane was the general favourite with children; her ways with them being
so playful, and her long circumstantial stories so delightful.&nbsp;
These were continued from time to time, and were begged for on all possible
and impossible occasions; woven, as <!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>she
proceeded, out of nothing but her own happy talent for invention.&nbsp;
Ah! if but one of them could be recovered!&nbsp; And again, as I grew
older, when the original seventeen years between our ages seemed to
shrink to seven, or to nothing, it comes back to me now how strangely
I missed her.&nbsp; It had become so much a habit with me to put by
things in my mind with a reference to her, and to say to myself, I shall
keep this for aunt Jane.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A nephew of hers used to observe that his visits to Chawton, after
the death of his aunt Jane, were always a disappointment to him.&nbsp;
From old associations he could not help expecting to be particularly
happy in that house; and never till he got there could he realise to
himself how all its peculiar charm was gone.&nbsp; It was not only that
the chief light in the house was quenched, but that the loss of it had
cast a shade over the spirits of the survivors.&nbsp; Enough has been
said to show her love for children, and her wonderful power of entertaining
them; but her friends of all ages felt her enlivening influence.&nbsp;
Her unusually quick sense of the ridiculous led her to play with all
the common-places of everyday life, whether as regarded persons or things;
but she never played with its serious duties or responsibilities, nor
did she ever turn individuals into ridicule.&nbsp; With all her neighbours
in the village she vas on friendly, though not on intimate, terms.&nbsp;
She took a kindly interest in all their proceedings, and liked to hear
about them.&nbsp; They often served for her <!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>amusement;
but it was her own nonsense that gave zest to the gossip.&nbsp; She
was as far as possible from being censorious or satirical.&nbsp; She
never abused them or <i>quizzed</i> them&mdash;<i>that</i> was the word
of the day; an ugly word, now obsolete; and the ugly practice which
it expressed is much less prevalent now than it was then.&nbsp; The
laugh which she occasionally raised was by imagining for her neighbours,
as she was equally ready to imagine for her friends or herself, impossible
contingencies, or by relating in prose or verse some trifling anecdote
coloured to her own fancy, or in writing a fictitious history of what
they were supposed to have said or done, which could deceive nobody.</p>
<p>The following specimens may be given of the liveliness of mind which
imparted an agreeable flavour both to her correspondence and her conversation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">On reading in the newspapers the
marriage of Mr. Gell to Miss Gill, of Eastbourne</span>.</p>

I do not think she was quite equal to my expectation.&nbsp; I fancy
I want something more than can be.&nbsp; Acting seldom satisfies me.&nbsp;

She is an elegant creature, however, and hugs Mr. Young delightfully.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So, Miss B. is actually married, but I have never seen it
in the papers; and one may as well be single if the wedding is not to
be in print.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once, too, she took it into her head to write the following mock
panegyric on a young friend, who really was clever and handsome:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>1.</p>
<p>In measured verse I&rsquo;ll now rehearse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The charms of lovely Anna:<br />
And, first, her mind is unconfined<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like any vast savannah.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Her fancy&rsquo;s ample bound:<br />
Its circuit may, on strict survey<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Five hundred miles be found.</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>Her wit descends on foes and friends<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like famed Niagara&rsquo;s Fall;<br />
And travellers gaze in wild amaze,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And listen, one and all.</p>
<p><!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>4.</p>
<p>Her judgment sound, thick, black, profound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like transatlantic groves,<br />
Dispenses aid, and friendly shade<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To all that in it roves.</p>
<p>5.</p>
<p>If thus her mind to be defined<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; America exhausts,<br />
And all that&rsquo;s grand in that great land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In similes it costs&mdash;</p>
<p>6.</p>
<p>Oh how can I her person try<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To image and portray?<br />
How paint the face, the form how trace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In which those virtues lay?</p>
<p>7.</p>
<p>Another world must be unfurled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Another language known,<br />
Ere tongue or sound can publish round<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her charms of flesh and bone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe that all this nonsense was nearly extempore, and that the
fancy of drawing the images from America arose at the moment from the
obvious rhyme which presented itself in the first stanza.</p>
<p>The following extracts are from letters addressed to a niece who
was at that time amusing herself by attempting a novel, probably never
finished, <!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>certainly
never published, and of which I know nothing but what these extracts
tell.&nbsp; They show the good-natured sympathy and encouragement which
the aunt, then herself occupied in writing &lsquo;Emma,&rsquo; could
give to the less matured powers of the niece.&nbsp; They bring out incidentally
some of her opinions concerning compositions of that kind:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Extracts</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Chawton, Aug. 10, 1814.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your aunt C. does not like desultory novels, and is rather
fearful that yours will be too much so; that there will be too frequent
a change from one set of people to another, and that circumstances will
be sometimes introduced, of apparent consequence, which will lead to
nothing.&nbsp; It will not be so great an objection to me.&nbsp; I allow
much more latitude than she does, and think nature and spirit cover
many sins of a wandering story.&nbsp; And people in general do not care
much about it, for your comfort . . .&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sept. 9.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are now collecting your people delightfully, getting them
exactly into such a spot as is the delight of my life.&nbsp; Three or
four families in a country village is the very thing to work on; and
I hope you will write a great deal more, and make full use of them while
they are so very favourably arranged.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>&lsquo;Sept.
28.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Devereux Forrester being ruined by his vanity is very good:
but I wish you would not let him plunge into a &ldquo;vortex of dissipation.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I do not object to the thing, but I cannot bear the expression: it is
such thorough novel slang; and so old that I dare say Adam met with
it in the first novel that he opened.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hans Place (Nov. 1814).</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been very far from finding your book an evil, I assure
you.&nbsp; I read it immediately, and with great pleasure.&nbsp; Indeed,
I do think you get on very fast.&nbsp; I wish other people of my acquaintance
could compose as rapidly.&nbsp; Julian&rsquo;s history was quite a surprise
to me.&nbsp; You had not very long known it yourself, I suspect; but
I have no objection to make to the circumstance; it is very well told,
and his having been in love with the aunt gives Cecilia an additional
interest with him.&nbsp; I like the idea; a very proper compliment to
an aunt!&nbsp; I rather imagine, indeed, that nieces are seldom chosen
but in compliment to some aunt or other.&nbsp; I dare say your husband
was in love with me once, and would never have thought of you if he
had not supposed me dead of a scarlet fever.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Jane Austen was successful in everything that she attempted with
her fingers.&nbsp; None of us could throw spilikins in so perfect a
circle, or take them off with so steady a hand.&nbsp; Her performances
with cup and <!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>ball
were marvellous.&nbsp; The one used at Chawton was an easy one, and
she has been known to catch it on the point above an hundred times in
succession, till her hand was weary.&nbsp; She sometimes found a resource
in that simple game, when unable, from weakness in her eyes, to read
or write long together.&nbsp; A specimen of her clear strong handwriting
is here given.&nbsp; Happy would the compositors for the press be if
they had always so legible a manuscript to work from.&nbsp; But the
writing was not the only part of her letters which showed superior handiwork.&nbsp;
In those days there was an art in folding and sealing.&nbsp; No adhesive
envelopes made all easy.&nbsp; Some people&rsquo;s letters always looked
loose and untidy; but her paper was sure to take the right folds, and
her sealing-wax to drop into the right place.&nbsp; Her needlework both
plain and ornamental was excellent, and might almost have put a sewing
machine to shame.&nbsp; She was considered especially great in satin
stitch.&nbsp; She spent much time in these occupations, and some of
her merriest talk was over clothes which she and her companions were
making, sometimes for themselves, and sometimes for the poor.&nbsp;
There still remains a curious specimen of her needlework made for a
sister-in-law, my mother.&nbsp; In a very small bag is deposited a little
rolled up housewife, furnished with minikin needles and fine thread.&nbsp;
In the housewife is a tiny pocket, and in the pocket is enclosed a slip
of paper, on which, written as with a crow quill, are these lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>This
little bag, I hope, will prove<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To be not vainly made;<br />
For should you thread and needles want,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It will afford you aid.</p>
<p>And, as we are about to part,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;T will serve another end:<br />
For, when you look upon this bag,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll recollect your friend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the kind of article that some benevolent fairy might be supposed
to give as a reward to a diligent little girl.&nbsp; The whole is of
flowered silk, and having been never used and carefully preserved, it
is as fresh and bright as when it was first made seventy years ago;
and shows that the same hand which painted so exquisitely with the pen
could work as delicately with the needle.</p>
<p>I have collected some of the bright qualities which shone, as it
were, on the surface of Jane Austen&rsquo;s character, and attracted
most notice; but underneath them there lay the strong foundations of
sound sense and judgment, rectitude of principle, and delicacy of feeling,
qualifying her equally to advise, assist, or amuse.&nbsp; She was, in
fact, as ready to comfort the unhappy, or to nurse the sick, as she
was to laugh and jest with the lighthearted.&nbsp; Two of her nieces
were grown up, and one of them was married, before she was taken away
from them.&nbsp; As their minds became more matured, they were admitted
into closer intimacy with her, <!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>and
learned more of her graver thoughts; they know what a sympathising friend
and judicious adviser they found her to be in many little difficulties
and doubts of early womanhood.</p>
<p>I do not venture to speak of her religious principles: that is a
subject on which she herself was more inclined to <i>think</i> and <i>act</i>
than to <i>talk</i>, and I shall imitate her reserve; satisfied to have
shown how much of Christian love and humility abounded in her heart,
without presuming to lay bare the roots whence those graces grew.&nbsp;
Some little insight, however, into these deeper recesses of the heart
must be given, when we come to speak of her death.</p>

VI.</h2>
<p><i>Habits of Composition resumed after a long interval&mdash;First
publication&mdash;The interest taken by the Author in the success of
her Works</i>.</p>
<p>It may seem extraordinary that Jane Austen should have written so
little during the years that elapsed between leaving Steventon and settling
at Chawton; especially when this cessation from work is contrasted with
her literary activity both before and after that period.&nbsp; It might
rather have been expected that fresh scenes and new acquaintance would
have called forth her powers; while the quiet life which the family
led both at Bath and Southampton must have afforded abundant leisure
for composition; but so it was that nothing which I know of, certainly
nothing which the public have seen, was completed in either of those
places.&nbsp; I can only state the fact, without assigning any cause
for it; but as soon as she was fixed in her second home, she resumed
the habits of composition which had been formed in her first, and continued
them to the end of her life.&nbsp; The first year of her residence at
Chawton seems to have been devoted to revising and preparing for the
press &lsquo;Sense and Sensibility,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Pride and Prejudice&rsquo;;
but between February 1811 and August 1816, she began and completed &lsquo;Mansfield
Park,&rsquo; &lsquo;Emma,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Persuasion,&rsquo; so <!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>that
the last five years of her life produced the same number of novels with
those which had been written in her early youth.&nbsp; How she was able
to effect all this is surprising, for she had no separate study to retire
to, and most of the work must have been done in the general sitting-room,
subject to all kinds of casual interruptions.&nbsp; She was careful
that her occupation should not be suspected by servants, or visitors,
or any persons beyond her own family party.&nbsp; She wrote upon small
sheets of paper which could easily be put away, or covered with a piece
of blotting paper.&nbsp; There was, between the front door and the offices,
a swing door which creaked when it was opened; but she objected to having
this little inconvenience remedied, because it gave her notice when
anyone was coming.&nbsp; She was not, however, troubled with companions
like her own Mrs. Allen in &lsquo;Northanger Abbey,&rsquo; whose &lsquo;vacancy
of mind and incapacity for thinking were such that, as she never talked
a great deal, so she could never be entirely silent; and therefore,
while she sat at work, if she lost her needle, or broke her thread,
or saw a speck of dirt on her gown, she must observe it, whether there
were any one at leisure to answer her or not.&rsquo;&nbsp; In that well
occupied female party there must have been many precious hours of silence
during which the pen was busy at the little mahogany writing-desk, <a name="citation102"></a><a href="#footnote102">{102}</a>
while Fanny Price, or <!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>Emma
Woodhouse, or Anne Elliott was growing into beauty and interest.&nbsp;
I have no doubt that I, and my sisters and cousins, in our visits to
Chawton, frequently disturbed this mystic process, without having any
idea of the mischief that we were doing; certainly we never should have
guessed it by any signs of impatience or irritability in the writer.</p>
<p>As so much had been previously prepared, when once she began to publish,
her works came out in quick succession.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sense and Sensibility&rsquo;
was published in 1811, &lsquo;Pride and Prejudice&rsquo; at the beginning
of 1813, &lsquo;Mansfield Park&rsquo; in 1814, &lsquo;Emma&rsquo; early
in 1816; &lsquo;Northanger Abbey&rsquo; and &lsquo;Persuasion&rsquo;
did not appear till after her death, in 1818.&nbsp; It will be shown
farther on why &lsquo;Northanger Abbey,&rsquo; though amongst the first
written, was one of the last published.&nbsp; Her first three novels
were published by Egerton, her last three by Murray.&nbsp; The profits
of the four which had been printed before her death had not at that
time amounted to seven hundred pounds.</p>
<p>I have no record of the publication of &lsquo;Sense and Sensibility,&rsquo;
nor of the author&rsquo;s feelings at this her first appearance before
the public; but the following extracts from three letters to her sister
give a lively picture of the interest with which she watched the reception
of &lsquo;Pride and Prejudice,&rsquo; and show the carefulness with
which she corrected <!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>her
compositions, and rejected much that had been written:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Chawton, Friday, January 29 (1813).</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope you received my little parcel by J. Bond on Wednesday
evening, my dear Cassandra, and that you will be ready to hear from
me again on Sunday, for I feel that I must write to you to-day.&nbsp;
I want to tell you that I have got my own darling child from London.&nbsp;
On Wednesday I received one copy sent down by Falkener, with three lines
from Henry to say that he had given another to Charles and sent a third
by the coach to Godmersham . . . .&nbsp; The advertisement is in our
paper to-day for the first time: 18<i>s</i>.&nbsp; He shall ask 1<i>l</i>.
1<i>s</i>. for my two next, and 1<i>l</i>. 8<i>s</i>. for my stupidest
of all.&nbsp; Miss B. dined with us on the very day of the book&rsquo;s
coming, and in the evening we fairly set at it, and read half the first
vol. to her, prefacing that, having intelligence from Henry that such
a work would soon appear, we had desired him to send it whenever it
came out, and I believe it passed with her unsuspected.&nbsp; She was
amused, poor soul!&nbsp; <i>That</i> she could not help, you know, with
two such people to lead the way, but she really does seem to admire
Elizabeth.&nbsp; I must confess that I think her as delightful a creature
as ever appeared in print, and how I shall be able to tolerate those
who do not like <i>her</i> at least I do not know.&nbsp; There are a
few typical errors; and a &ldquo;said he,&rdquo; or a &ldquo;said she,&rdquo;
would sometimes make the dialogue more immediately <!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>clear;
but &ldquo;I do not write for such dull elves&rdquo; as have not a great
deal of ingenuity themselves.&nbsp; The second volume is shorter than
I could wish, but the difference is not so much in reality as in look,
there being a larger proportion of narrative in that part.&nbsp; I have
lop&rsquo;t and crop&rsquo;t so successfully, however, that I imagine
it must be rather shorter than &ldquo;Sense and Sensibility&rdquo; altogether.&nbsp;
Now I will try and write of something else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Chawton, Thursday, February 4 (1813).</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,&mdash;Your letter
was truly welcome, and I am much obliged to you for all your praise;
it came at a right time, for I had had some fits of disgust.&nbsp; Our
second evening&rsquo;s reading to Miss B. had not pleased me so well,
but I believe something must be attributed to my mother&rsquo;s too
rapid way of getting on: though she perfectly understands the characters
herself, she cannot speak as they ought.&nbsp; Upon the whole, however,
I am quite vain enough and well satisfied enough.&nbsp; The work is
rather too light, and bright, and sparkling; it wants shade; it wants
to be stretched out here and there with a long chapter of sense, if
it could be had; if not, of solemn specious nonsense, about something
unconnected with the story; an essay on writing, a critique on Walter
Scott, or the history of Buonapart&eacute;, or something that would
form a contrast, and bring the reader with increased delight to the
playfulness and epigrammatism of <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>the
general style . . . .&nbsp; The greatest blunder in the printing that
I have met with is in page 220, v. 3, where two speeches are made into
one.&nbsp; There might as well be no suppers at Longbourn; but I suppose
it was the remains of Mrs. Bennett&rsquo;s old Meryton habits.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following letter seems to have been written soon after the last
two: in February 1813:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;This will be a quick return for yours, my dear
Cassandra; I doubt its having much else to recommend it; but there is
no saying; it may turn out to be a very long and delightful letter.&nbsp;
I am exceedingly pleased that you can say what you do, after having
gone through the whole work, and Fanny&rsquo;s praise is very gratifying.&nbsp;
My hopes were tolerably strong of <i>her</i>, but nothing like a certainty.&nbsp;
Her liking Darcy and Elizabeth is enough.&nbsp; She might hate all the
others, if she would.&nbsp; I have her opinion under her own hand this
morning, but your transcript of it, which I read first, was not, and
is not, the less acceptable.&nbsp; To <i>me</i> it is of course all
praise, but the more exact truth which she sends you is good enough
. . . .&nbsp; Our party on Wednesday was not unagreeable, though we
wanted a master of the house less anxious and fidgety, and more conversable.&nbsp;
Upon Mrs. ---&rsquo;s mentioning that she had sent the rejected addresses
to Mrs. H., I began talking to her a little about them, and expressed
my hope of their having amused her.&nbsp; Her answer <!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>was,
&ldquo;Oh dear yes, very much, very droll indeed, the opening of the
house, and the striking up of the fiddles!&rdquo;&nbsp; What she meant,
poor woman, who shall say?&nbsp; I sought no farther.&nbsp; As soon
as a whist party was formed, and a round table threatened, I made my
mother an excuse and came away, leaving just as many for <i>their</i>
round table as there were at Mrs. Grant&rsquo;s. <a name="citation107"></a><a href="#footnote107">{107}</a>&nbsp;
I wish they might be as agreeable a set.&nbsp; My mother is very well,
and finds great amusement in glove-knitting, and at present wants no
other work.&nbsp; We quite run over with books.&nbsp; She has got Sir
John Carr&rsquo;s &ldquo;Travels in Spain,&rdquo; and I am reading a
Society octavo, an &ldquo;Essay on the Military Police and Institutions
of the British Empire,&rdquo; by Capt. Pasley of the Engineers, a book
which I protested against at first, but which upon trial I find delightfully
written and highly entertaining.&nbsp; I am as much in love with the
author as I ever was with Clarkson or Buchanan, or even the two Mr.
Smiths of the city.&nbsp; The first soldier I ever sighed for; but he
does write with extraordinary force and spirit.&nbsp; Yesterday, moreover,
brought us &ldquo;Mrs. Grant&rsquo;s Letters,&rdquo; with Mr. White&rsquo;s
compliments; but I have disposed of them, compliments and all, to Miss
P., and amongst so many readers or retainers of books as we have in
Chawton, I dare say there will be no difficulty in getting rid of them
for another fortnight, if necessary.&nbsp; I have disposed of Mrs. Grant
for the second fortnight to Mrs. ---.&nbsp; <!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>It
can make no difference to <i>her</i> which of the twenty-six fortnights
in the year the 3 vols. lie on her table.&nbsp; I have been applied
to for information as to the oath taken in former times of Bell, Book,
and Candle, but have none to give.&nbsp; Perhaps you may be able to
learn something of its origin where you now are.&nbsp; Ladies who read
those enormous great stupid thick quarto volumes which one always sees
in the breakfast parlour there must be acquainted with everything in
the world.&nbsp; I detest a quarto.&nbsp; Capt. Pasley&rsquo;s book
is too good for their society.&nbsp; They will not understand a man
who condenses his thoughts into an octavo.&nbsp; I have learned from
Sir J. Carr that there is no Government House at Gibraltar.&nbsp; I
must alter it to the Commissioner&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following letter belongs to the same year, but treats of a different
subject.&nbsp; It describes a journey from Chawton to London, in her
brother&rsquo;s curricle, and shows how much could be seen and enjoyed
in course of a long summer&rsquo;s day by leisurely travelling amongst
scenery which the traveller in an express train now rushes through in
little more than an hour, but scarcely sees at all:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Sloane Street, Thursday, May 20 (1813).</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Cassandra</span>,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Before I say anything else, I claim a paper full of halfpence
on the drawing-room mantel-piece; I put them there myself, and forgot
to bring them <!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>with
me.&nbsp; I cannot say that I have yet been in any distress for money,
but I chuse to have my due, as well as the Devil.&nbsp; How lucky we
were in our weather yesterday!&nbsp; This wet morning makes one more
sensible of it.&nbsp; We had no rain of any consequence.&nbsp; The head
of the curricle was put half up three or four times, but our share of
the showers was very trifling, though they seemed to be heavy all round
us, when we were on the Hog&rsquo;s-back, and I fancied it might then
be raining so hard at Chawton as to make you feel for us much more than
we deserved.&nbsp; Three hours and a quarter took us to Guildford, where
we staid barely two hours, and had only just time enough for all we
had to do there; that is, eating a long and comfortable breakfast, watching
the carriages, paying Mr. Harrington, and taking a little stroll afterwards.&nbsp;
From some views which that stroll gave us, I think most highly of the
situation of Guildford.&nbsp; We wanted all our brothers and sisters
to be standing with us in the bowling-green, and looking towards Horsham.&nbsp;
I was very lucky in my gloves&mdash;got them at the first shop I went
to, though I went into it rather because it was near than because it
looked at all like a glove shop, and gave only four shillings for them;
after which everybody at Chawton will be hoping and predicting that
they cannot be good for anything, and their worth certainly remains
to be proved; but I think they look very well.&nbsp; We left Guildford
at twenty minutes before twelve (I hope somebody <!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>cares
for these minuti&aelig;), and were at Esher in about two hours more.&nbsp;
I was very much pleased with the country in general.&nbsp; Between Guildford
and Ripley I thought it particularly pretty, also about Painshill; and
from a Mr. Spicer&rsquo;s grounds at Esher, which we walked into before
dinner, the views were beautiful.&nbsp; I cannot say what we did not
see, but I should think there could not be a wood, or a meadow, or palace,
or remarkable spot in England that was not spread out before us on one
side or other.&nbsp; Claremont is going to be sold: a Mr. Ellis has
it now.&nbsp; It is a house that seems never to have prospered.&nbsp;
After dinner we walked forward to be overtaken at the coachman&rsquo;s
time, and before he did overtake us we were very near Kingston.&nbsp;
I fancy it was about half-past six when we reached this house&mdash;a
twelve hours&rsquo; business, and the horses did not appear more than
reasonably tired.&nbsp; I was very tired too, and glad to get to bed
early, but am quite well to-day.&nbsp; I am very snug in the front drawing-room
all to myself, and would not say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; for any company
but you.&nbsp; The quietness of it does me good.&nbsp; I have contrived
to pay my two visits, though the weather made me a great while about

She looks very well, and her hair is done up with an elegance to do
credit to any education.&nbsp; Her manners are as <!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>unaffected
and pleasing as ever.&nbsp; She had heard from her mother to-day.&nbsp;
Mrs. Craven spends another fortnight at Chilton.&nbsp; I saw nobody
but Charlotte, which pleased me best.&nbsp; I was shewn upstairs into
a drawing-room, where she came to me, and the appearance of the room,
so totally unschool-like, amused me very much; it was full of modern
elegancies.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yours very affec<sup>tly</sup>.,<br />

<p>The next letter, written in the following year, contains an account
of another journey to London, with her brother Henry, and reading with
him the manuscript of &lsquo;Mansfield Park&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>

we were at Cobham.&nbsp; On reaching G. we found that John and the horses
were gone on.&nbsp; We therefore did no more than we had done at Farnham&mdash;sit
in the carriage while fresh horses were put in, and proceeded directly
to Cobham, which we reached by seven, and about eight were sitting down
to a very nice roast fowl, &amp;c.&nbsp; We had altogether a very good
journey, and everything at Cobham was comfortable.&nbsp; I could not
pay Mr. Harrington!&nbsp; That was the only alas! of the business.&nbsp;
I shall therefore return his bill, and my mother&rsquo;s 2<i>l</i>.,
that you may try your luck.&nbsp; We did <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>not
begin reading till Bentley Green.&nbsp; Henry&rsquo;s approbation is
hitherto even equal to my wishes.&nbsp; He says it is different from
the other two, but does not appear to think it at all inferior.&nbsp;
He has only married Mrs. R.&nbsp; I am afraid he has gone through the
most entertaining part.&nbsp; He took to Lady B. and Mrs. N. most kindly,
and gives great praise to the drawing of the characters.&nbsp; He understands
them all, likes Fanny, and, I think, foresees how it will all be.&nbsp;
I finished the &ldquo;Heroine&rdquo; last night, and was very much amused
by it.&nbsp; I wonder James did not like it better.&nbsp; It diverted
me exceedingly.&nbsp; We went to bed at ten.&nbsp; I was very tired,
but slept to a miracle, and am lovely to-day, and at present Henry seems
to have no complaint.&nbsp; We left Cobham at half-past eight, stopped
to bait and breakfast at Kingston, and were in this house considerably
before two.&nbsp; Nice smiling Mr. Barlowe met us at the door and, in
reply to enquiries after news, said that peace was generally expected.&nbsp;
I have taken possession of my bedroom, unpacked my bandbox, sent Miss

B., and am now writing by myself at the new table in the front room.&nbsp;
It is snowing.&nbsp; We had some snowstorms yesterday, and a smart frost
at night, which gave us a hard road from Cobham to Kingston; but as
it was then getting dirty and heavy, Henry had a pair of leaders put
on to the bottom of Sloane St.&nbsp; His own horses, therefore, cannot
have had <!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>hard
work.&nbsp; I watched for <i>veils</i> as we drove through the streets,
and had the pleasure of seeing several upon vulgar heads.&nbsp; And
now, how do you all do?&mdash;you in particular, after the worry of
yesterday and the day before.&nbsp; I hope Martha had a pleasant visit
again, and that you and my mother could eat your beef-pudding.&nbsp;
Depend upon my thinking of the chimney-sweeper as soon as I wake to-morrow.&nbsp;
Places are secured at Drury Lane for Saturday, but so great is the rage
for seeing Kean that only a third and fourth row could be got; as it
is in a front box, however, I hope we shall do pretty well&mdash;Shylock,

and I have torn through the third vol. of the &ldquo;Heroine.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I do not think it falls off.&nbsp; It is a delightful burlesque, particularly
on the Radcliffe style.&nbsp; Henry is going on with &ldquo;Mansfield
Park.&rdquo;&nbsp; He admires H.&nbsp; Crawford: I mean properly, as

how much you will enjoy it.&nbsp; We hear that Mr. Kean is more admired

VII.</h3>
<p><i>Seclusion from the literary world&mdash;Notice from the Prince
Regent&mdash;Correspondence with Mr. Clarke&mdash;Suggestions to alter
her style of writing</i>.</p>
<p>Jane Austen lived in entire seclusion from the literary world: neither
by correspondence, nor by personal intercourse was she known to any
contemporary authors.&nbsp; It is probable that she never was in company
with any person whose talents or whose celebrity equalled her own; so
that her powers never could have been sharpened by collision with superior
intellects, nor her imagination aided by their casual suggestions.&nbsp;
Whatever she produced was a genuine home-made article.&nbsp; Even during
the last two or three years of her life, when her works were rising
in the estimation of the public, they did not enlarge the circle of
her acquaintance.&nbsp; Few of her readers knew even her name, and none
knew more of her than her name.&nbsp; I doubt whether it would be possible
to mention any other author of note, whose personal obscurity was so
complete.&nbsp; I can think of none like her, but of many to contrast
with her in that respect.&nbsp; Fanny Burney, afterwards Madame D&rsquo;Arblay,
was at an early age petted by Dr. Johnson, and introduced to the wits
and scholars of the day at the tables of Mrs. Thrale and <!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>Sir
Joshua Reynolds.&nbsp; Anna Seward, in her self-constituted shrine at
Lichfield, would have been miserable, had she not trusted that the eyes
of all lovers of poetry were devoutly fixed on her.&nbsp; Joanna Baillie
and Maria Edgeworth were indeed far from courting publicity; they loved
the privacy of their own families, one with her brother and sister in
their Hampstead villa, the other in her more distant retreat in Ireland;
but fame pursued them, and they were the favourite correspondents of
Sir Walter Scott.&nbsp; Crabbe, who was usually buried in a country
parish, yet sometimes visited London, and dined at Holland House, and
was received as a fellow-poet by Campbell, Moore, and Rogers; and on
one memorable occasion he was Scott&rsquo;s guest at Edinburgh, and
gazed with wondering eyes on the incongruous pageantry with which George
IV. was entertained in that city.&nbsp; Even those great writers who
hid themselves amongst lakes and mountains associated with each other;
and though little seen by the world were so much in its thoughts that
a new term, &lsquo;Lakers,&rsquo; was coined to designate them.&nbsp;
The chief part of Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s life was spent in a
wild solitude compared with which Steventon and Chawton might be considered
to be in the gay world; and yet she attained to personal distinction
which never fell to Jane&rsquo;s lot.&nbsp; When she visited her kind
publisher in London, literary men and women were invited purposely to
meet her: Thackeray bestowed upon <!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>her
the honour of his notice; and once in Willis&rsquo;s Rooms, <a name="citation117"></a><a href="#footnote117">{117}</a>
she had to walk shy and trembling through an avenue of lords and ladies,
drawn up for the purpose of gazing at the author of &lsquo;Jane Eyre.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Miss Mitford, too, lived quietly in &lsquo;Our Village,&rsquo; devoting
her time and talents to the benefit of a father scarcely worthy of her;
but she did not live there unknown.&nbsp; Her tragedies gave her a name
in London.&nbsp; She numbered Milman and Talfourd amongst her correspondents;
and her works were a passport to the society of many who would not otherwise
have sought her.&nbsp; Hundreds admired Miss Mitford on account of her
writings for one who ever connected the idea of Miss Austen with the
press.&nbsp; A few years ago, a gentleman visiting Winchester Cathedral
desired to be shown Miss Austen&rsquo;s grave.&nbsp; The verger, as
he pointed it out, asked, &lsquo;Pray, sir, can you tell me whether
there was anything particular about that lady; so many people want to
know where she was buried?&rsquo;&nbsp; During her life the ignorance
of the verger was shared by most people; few knew that &lsquo;there
was anything particular about that lady.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was not till towards the close of her life, when the last of the
works that she saw published was in the press, that she received the
only mark of distinction ever bestowed upon her; and that was remarkable
for the high quarter whence it emanated rather than for any actual increase
of fame that it <!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>conferred.&nbsp;
It happened thus.&nbsp; In the autumn of 1815 she nursed her brother
Henry through a dangerous fever and slow convalescence at his house
in Hans Place.&nbsp; He was attended by one of the Prince Regent&rsquo;s
physicians.&nbsp; All attempts to keep her name secret had at this time
ceased, and though it had never appeared on a title-page, all who cared
to know might easily learn it: and the friendly physician was aware
that his patient&rsquo;s nurse was the author of &lsquo;Pride and Prejudice.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Accordingly he informed her one day that the Prince was a great admirer
of her novels; that he read them often, and kept a set in every one
of his residences; that he himself therefore had thought it right to
inform his Royal Highness that Miss Austen was staying in London, and
that the Prince had desired Mr. Clarke, the librarian of Carlton House,
to wait upon her.&nbsp; The next day Mr. Clarke made his appearance,
and invited her to Carlton House, saying that he had the Prince&rsquo;s
instructions to show her the library and other apartments, and to pay
her every possible attention.&nbsp; The invitation was of course accepted,
and during the visit to Carlton House Mr. Clarke declared himself commissioned
to say that if Miss Austen had any other novel forthcoming she was at
liberty to dedicate it to the Prince.&nbsp; Accordingly such a dedication
was immediately prefixed to &lsquo;Emma,&rsquo; which was at that time
in the press.</p>
<p>Mr. Clarke was the brother of Dr. Clarke, the <!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>traveller
and mineralogist, whose life has been written by Bishop Otter.&nbsp;
Jane found in him not only a very courteous gentleman, but also a warm
admirer of her talents; though it will be seen by his letters that he
did not clearly apprehend the limits of her powers, or the proper field
for their exercise.&nbsp; The following correspondence took place between
them.</p>
<p>Feeling some apprehension lest she should make a mistake in acting
on the verbal permission which she had received from the Prince, Jane
addressed the following letter to Mr. Clarke:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Nov. 15, 1815.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I must take the liberty
of asking you a question.&nbsp; Among the many flattering attentions
which I received from you at Carlton House on Monday last was the information
of my being at liberty to dedicate any future work to His Royal Highness
the Prince Regent, without the necessity of any solicitation on my part.&nbsp;
Such, at least, I believed to be your words; but as I am very anxious
to be quite certain of what was intended, I entreat you to have the
goodness to inform me how such a permission is to be understood, and
whether it is incumbent on me to show my sense of the honour, by inscribing
the work now in the press to His Royal Highness; I should be equally
concerned to appear either presumptuous or ungrateful.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>The
following gracious answer was returned by Mr. Clarke, together with
a suggestion which must have been received with some surprise:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Carlton House, Nov. 16, 1815.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,&mdash;It is certainly
not <i>incumbent</i> on you to dedicate your work now in the press to
His Royal Highness; but if you wish to do the Regent that honour either
now or at any future period I am happy to send you that permission,
which need not require any more trouble or solicitation on your part.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your late works, Madam, and in particular &ldquo;Mansfield
Park,&rdquo; reflect the highest honour on your genius and your principles.&nbsp;
In every new work your mind seems to increase its energy and power of
discrimination.&nbsp; The Regent has read and admired all your publications.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Accept my best thanks for the pleasure your volumes have given
me.&nbsp; In the perusal of them I felt a great inclination to write
and say so.&nbsp; And I also, dear Madam, wished to be allowed to ask
you to delineate in some future work the habits of life, and character,
and enthusiasm of a clergyman, who should pass his time between the
metropolis and the country, who should be something like Beattie&rsquo;s
Minstrel&mdash;</p>
<p>Silent when glad, affectionate tho&rsquo; shy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in his looks was most demurely sad;<br />
And now he laughed aloud, yet none knew why.</p>
<p>Neither Goldsmith, nor La Fontaine in his &ldquo;Tableau de Famille,&rdquo;
have in my mind quite <!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>delineated
an English clergyman, at least of the present day, fond of and entirely
engaged in literature, no man&rsquo;s enemy but his own.&nbsp; Pray,
dear Madam, think of these things.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Believe me at all times with sincerity<br />
and respect, your faithful and obliged servant,<br />
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">J. S. Clarke</span>, Librarian.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following letter, written in reply, will show how unequal the
author of &lsquo;Pride and Prejudice&rsquo; felt herself to delineating
an enthusiastic clergyman of the present day, who should resemble Beattie&rsquo;s
Minstrel:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Dec. 11.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;My &ldquo;Emma&rdquo;
is now so near publication that I feel it right to assure you of my
not having forgotten your kind recommendation of an early copy for Carlton
House, and that I have Mr. Murray&rsquo;s promise of its being sent
to His Royal Highness, under cover to you, three days previous to the
work being really out.&nbsp; I must make use of this opportunity to
thank you, dear Sir, for the very high praise you bestow on my other
novels.&nbsp; I am too vain to wish to convince you that you have praised
them beyond their merits.&nbsp; My greatest anxiety at present is that
this fourth work should not disgrace what was good in the others.&nbsp;
But on this point I will do myself the justice to declare that, whatever
may be my wishes for its success, I am strongly haunted with the idea
that to those readers who have preferred &ldquo;Pride and Prejudice&rdquo;
<!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>it
will appear inferior in wit, and to those who have preferred &ldquo;Mansfield
Park&rdquo; inferior in good sense.&nbsp; Such as it is, however, I
hope you will do me the favour of accepting a copy.&nbsp; Mr. Murray
will have directions for sending one.&nbsp; I am quite honoured by your
thinking me capable of drawing such a clergyman as you gave the sketch
of in your note of Nov. 16th.&nbsp; But I assure you I am <i>not</i>.&nbsp;
The comic part of the character I might be equal to, but not the good,
the enthusiastic, the literary.&nbsp; Such a man&rsquo;s conversation
must at times be on subjects of science and philosophy, of which I know
nothing; or at least be occasionally abundant in quotations and allusions
which a woman who, like me, knows only her own mother tongue, and has
read little in that, would be totally without the power of giving.&nbsp;
A classical education, or at any rate a very extensive acquaintance
with English literature, ancient and modern, appears to me quite indispensable
for the person who would do any justice to your clergyman; and I think
I may boast myself to be, with all possible vanity, the most unlearned
and uninformed female who ever dared to be an authoress.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Believe me, dear Sir,<br />
&lsquo;Your obliged and faithful hum<sup>bl</sup> Ser<sup>t</sup>.<br />
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Jane Austen</span>.&rsquo; <a name="citation122"></a><a href="#footnote122">{122}</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>Mr.
Clarke, however, was not to be discouraged from proposing another subject.&nbsp;
He had recently been appointed chaplain and private English secretary
to Prince Leopold, who was then about to be united to the Princess Charlotte;
and when he again wrote to express the gracious thanks of the Prince
Regent for the copy of &lsquo;Emma&rsquo; which had been presented,
he suggests that &lsquo;an historical romance illustrative of the august
House of Cobourg would just now be very interesting,&rsquo; and might
very properly be dedicated to Prince Leopold.&nbsp; This was much as
if Sir William Ross had been set to paint a great battle-piece; and
it is amusing to see with what grave civility she declined a proposal
which must have struck her as ludicrous, in the following letter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I
am honoured by the Prince&rsquo;s thanks and very much obliged to yourself
for the kind manner in which you mention the work.&nbsp; I have also
to acknowledge a former letter forwarded to me from Hans Place.&nbsp;
I assure you I felt very grateful for the friendly tenor of it, and
hope my silence will have been considered, as it was truly meant, to
proceed only from an unwillingness to tax your time with idle thanks.&nbsp;
Under every interesting circumstance which your own talents and literary
labours have placed you in, or the favour of the Regent bestowed, you
have my best wishes.&nbsp; Your recent appointments I hope are a <!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>step
to something still better.&nbsp; In my opinion, the service of a court
can hardly be too well paid, for immense must be the sacrifice of time
and feeling required by it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are very kind in your hints as to the sort of composition
which might recommend me at present, and I am fully sensible that an
historical romance, founded on the House of Saxe Cobourg, might be much
more to the purpose of profit or popularity than such pictures of domestic
life in country villages as I deal in.&nbsp; But I could no more write
a romance than an epic poem.&nbsp; I could not sit seriously down to
write a serious romance under any other motive than to save my life;
and if it were indispensable for me to keep it up and never relax into
laughing at myself or at other people, I am sure I should be hung before
I had finished the first chapter.&nbsp; No, I must keep to my own style
and go on in my own way; and though I may never succeed again in that,
I am convinced that I should totally fail in any other.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I remain, my dear Sir,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your very much obliged, and sincere friend,<br />
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">J. Austen</span>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Chawton, near Alton, April 1, 1816.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Clarke should have recollected the warning of the wise man, &lsquo;Force
not the course of the river.&rsquo;&nbsp; If you divert it from the
channel in which nature taught it to flow, and force it into one arbitrarily
<!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>cut
by yourself, you will lose its grace and beauty.</p>
<blockquote><p>But when his free course is not hindered,<br />
He makes sweet music with the enamelled stones,<br />
Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge<br />
He overtaketh in his pilgrimage:<br />
And so by many winding nooks he strays<br />
With willing sport.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All writers of fiction, who have genius strong enough to work out
a course of their own, resist every attempt to interfere with its direction.&nbsp;
No two writers could be more unlike each other than Jane Austen and
Charlotte Bront&euml;; so much so that the latter was unable to understand
why the former was admired, and confessed that she herself &lsquo;should
hardly like to live with her ladies and gentlemen, in their elegant
but confined houses;&rsquo; but each writer equally resisted interference
with her own natural style of composition.&nbsp; Miss Bront&euml;, in
reply to a friendly critic, who had warned her against being too melodramatic,
and had ventured to propose Miss Austen&rsquo;s works to her as a study,
writes thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Whenever I <i>do</i> write another book, I think
I will have nothing of what you call &ldquo;melodrama.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I <i>think</i> so, but I am not sure.&nbsp; I <i>think</i>, too, I will
endeavour to follow the counsel which shines out of Miss Austen&rsquo;s
&ldquo;mild eyes,&rdquo; to finish more, and be more subdued; but neither
am I sure of that.&nbsp; When authors write best, or, at least, when
they write most fluently, an influence seems to waken in them which
becomes their master&mdash;which will have <!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>its
way&mdash;putting out of view all behests but its own, dictating certain
words, and insisting on their being used, whether vehement or measured
in their nature, new moulding characters, giving unthought of turns
to incidents, rejecting carefully elaborated old ideas, and suddenly
creating and adopting new ones.&nbsp; Is it not so?&nbsp; And should
we try to counteract this influence?&nbsp; Can we indeed counteract
it?&rsquo; <a name="citation126"></a><a href="#footnote126">{126}</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The playful raillery with which the one parries an attack on her
liberty, and the vehement eloquence of the other in pleading the same
cause and maintaining the independence of genius, are very characteristic
of the minds of the respective writers.</p>
<p>The suggestions which Jane received as to the sort of story that
she ought to write were, however, an amusement to her, though they were
not likely to prove useful; and she has left amongst her papers one
entitled, &lsquo;Plan of a novel according to hints from various quarters.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The names of some of those advisers are written on the margin of the
manuscript opposite to their respective suggestions.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Heroine to be the daughter of a clergyman, who
after having lived much in the world had retired from it, and settled
on a curacy with a very small fortune of his own.&nbsp; The most excellent
man that can be imagined, perfect in character, temper, and manner,
without the smallest drawback or peculiarity to prevent his being the
most delightful companion to his daughter from one year&rsquo;s end
to <!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>the
other.&nbsp; Heroine faultless in character, beautiful in person, and
possessing every possible accomplishment.&nbsp; Book to open with father
and daughter conversing in long speeches, elegant language, and a tone
of high serious sentiment.&nbsp; The father induced, at his daughter&rsquo;s
earnest request, to relate to her the past events of his life.&nbsp;
Narrative to reach through the greater part of the first volume; as
besides all the circumstances of his attachment to her mother, and their
marriage, it will comprehend his going to sea as chaplain to a distinguished
naval character about the court; and his going afterwards to court himself,
which involved him in many interesting situations, concluding with his
opinion of the benefits of tithes being done away with . . . .&nbsp;
From this outset the story will proceed, and contain a striking variety
of adventures.&nbsp; Father an exemplary parish priest, and devoted
to literature; but heroine and father never above a fortnight in one
place: he being driven from his curacy by the vile arts of some totally
unprincipled and heartless young man, desperately in love with the heroine,
and pursuing her with unrelenting passion.&nbsp; No sooner settled in
one country of Europe, than they are compelled to quit it, and retire
to another, always making new acquaintance, and always obliged to leave
them.&nbsp; This will of course exhibit a wide variety of character.&nbsp;
The scene will be for ever shifting from one set of people to another,
but there will be no mixture, all the <!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>good
will be unexceptionable in every respect.&nbsp; There will be no foibles
or weaknesses but with the wicked, who will be completely depraved and
infamous, hardly a resemblance of humanity left in them.&nbsp; Early
in her career, the heroine must meet with the hero: all perfection,
of course, and only prevented from paying his addresses to her by some
excess of refinement.&nbsp; Wherever she goes, somebody falls in love
with her, and she receives repeated offers of marriage, which she refers
wholly to her father, exceedingly angry that he should not be the first
applied to.&nbsp; Often carried away by the anti-hero, but rescued either
by her father or the hero.&nbsp; Often reduced to support herself and
her father by her talents, and work for her bread; continually cheated,
and defrauded of her hire; worn down to a skeleton, and now and then
starved to death.&nbsp; At last, hunted out of civilised society, denied
the poor shelter of the humblest cottage, they are compelled to retreat
into Kamtschatka, where the poor father quite worn down, finding his
end approaching, throws himself on the ground, and after four or five
hours of tender advice and parental admonition to his miserable child,
expires in a fine burst of literary enthusiasm, intermingled with invectives
against the holders of tithes.&nbsp; Heroine inconsolable for some time,
but afterwards crawls back towards her former country, having at least
twenty narrow escapes of falling into the hands of anti-hero; and at
last, in the very nick of time, turning a corner to <!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>avoid
him, runs into the arms of the hero himself, who, having just shaken
off the scruples which fettered him before, was at the very moment setting
off in pursuit of her.&nbsp; The tenderest and completest <i>&eacute;claircissement</i>
takes place, and they are happily united.&nbsp; Throughout the whole
work heroine to be in the most elegant society, and living in high style.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the first publication of this memoir, Mr. Murray of Albemarle
Street has very kindly sent to me copies of the following letters, which
his father received from Jane Austen, when engaged in the publication
of &lsquo;Emma.&rsquo;&nbsp; The increasing cordiality of the letters
shows that the author felt that her interests were duly cared for, and
was glad to find herself in the hands of a publisher whom she could
consider as a friend.</p>
<p>Her brother had addressed to Mr. Murray a strong complaint of the
tardiness of a printer:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;23 Hans Place, Thursday, November 23 (1815).</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;My brother&rsquo;s note
last Monday has been so fruitless, that I am afraid there can be but
little chance of my writing to any good effect; but yet I am so very
much disappointed and vexed by the delays of the printers, that I cannot
help begging to know whether there is no hope of their being quickened.&nbsp;
Instead of the work being ready by the end of the present month, it
will hardly, at the rate we now proceed, be finished by the end of the
next; and as I expect to leave London early in December, it is <!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>of
consequence that no more time should be lost.&nbsp; Is it likely that
the printers will be influenced to greater dispatch and punctuality
by knowing that the work is to be dedicated, by permission, to the Prince
Regent?&nbsp; If you can make that circumstance operate, I shall be
very glad.&nbsp; My brother returns &ldquo;Waterloo&rdquo; with many
thanks for the loan of it.&nbsp; We have heard much of Scott&rsquo;s

If it be not incompatible with other arrangements, would you favour
us with it, supposing you have any set already opened?&nbsp; You may
depend upon its being in careful hands.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I remain, Sir, your ob<sup>t</sup>. humble Se<sup>t</sup>.<br />
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">J. Austen</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hans Place, December 11 (1815).</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;As I find that
&ldquo;Emma&rdquo; is advertised for publication as early as Saturday
next, I think it best to lose no time in settling all that remains to
be settled on the subject, and adopt this method as involving the smallest
tax on your time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the first place, I beg you to understand that I leave the
terms on which the trade should be supplied with the work entirely to
your judgment, entreating you to be guided in every such arrangement
by your own experience of what is most likely to clear off the edition
rapidly.&nbsp; I shall be satisfied with whatever you feel to be best.&nbsp;
The title-page must be &ldquo;Emma, dedicated by permission to <!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>H.R.H.
the Prince Regent.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it is my particular wish that one
set should be completed and sent to H.R.H. two or three days before
the work is generally public.&nbsp; It should be sent under cover to
the Rev. J. S. Clarke, Librarian, Carlton House.&nbsp; I shall subjoin
a list of those persons to whom I must trouble you to forward also a
set each, when the work is out; all unbound, with &ldquo;From the Authoress&rdquo;
in the first page.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I return you, with very many thanks, the books you have so
obligingly supplied me with.&nbsp; I am very sensible, I assure you,
of the attention you have paid to my convenience and amusement.&nbsp;
I return also &ldquo;Mansfield Park,&rdquo; as ready for a second edition,
I believe, as I can make it.&nbsp; I am in Hans Place till the 16th.&nbsp;
From that day inclusive, my direction will be Chawton, Alton, Hants.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I remain, dear Sir,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Y<sup>r</sup> faithful humb. Serv<sup>t</sup>.<br />
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">J. Austen</span>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish you would have the goodness to send a line by the bearer,
stating <i>the day</i> on which the set will be ready for the Prince
Regent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hans Place, December 11 (1815).</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am much obliged
by yours, and very happy to feel everything arranged to our mutual satisfaction.&nbsp;
As to my direction about the title-page, it was arising from my ignorance
only, and from my having never noticed the proper place <!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>for
a dedication.&nbsp; I thank you for putting me right.&nbsp; Any deviation
from what is usually done in such cases is the last thing I should wish
for.&nbsp; I feel happy in having a friend to save me from the ill effect
of my own blunder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yours, dear Sir, &amp;c.<br />
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">J. Austen</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Chawton, April 1, 1816.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I return you the
&ldquo;Quarterly Review&rdquo; with many thanks.&nbsp; The Authoress
of &ldquo;Emma&rdquo; has no reason, I think, to complain of her treatment
in it, except in the total omission of &ldquo;Mansfield Park.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I cannot but be sorry that so clever a man as the Reviewer of &ldquo;Emma&rdquo;
should consider it as unworthy of being noticed.&nbsp; You will be pleased
to hear that I have received the Prince&rsquo;s thanks for the <i>handsome</i>
copy I sent him of &ldquo;Emma.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whatever he may think of
<i>my</i> share of the work, yours seems to have been quite right.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In consequence of the late event in Henrietta Street, I must
request that if you should at any time have anything to communicate
by letter, you will be so good as to write by the post, directing to
me (Miss J. Austen), Chawton, near Alton; and that for anything of a
larger bulk, you will add to the same direction, by <i>Collier&rsquo;s
Southampton coach</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I remain, dear Sir,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yours very faithfully,<br />

VIII.</h2>
<p><i>Slow growth of her fame&mdash;Ill success of first attempts at
publication&mdash;Two Reviews of her works contrasted</i>.</p>
<p>Seldom has any literary reputation been of such slow growth as that
of Jane Austen.&nbsp; Readers of the present day know the rank that
is generally assigned to her.&nbsp; They have been told by Archbishop
Whately, in his review of her works, and by Lord Macaulay, in his review
of Madame D&rsquo;Arblay&rsquo;s, the reason why the highest place is
to be awarded to Jane Austen, as a truthful drawer of character, and
why she is to be classed with those who have approached nearest, in
that respect, to the great master Shakspeare.&nbsp; They see her safely
placed, by such authorities, in her niche, not indeed amongst the highest
orders of genius, but in one confessedly her own, in our British temple
of literary fame; and it may be difficult to make them believe how coldly
her works were at first received, and how few readers had any appreciation
of their peculiar merits.&nbsp; Sometimes a friend or neighbour, who
chanced to know of our connection with the author, would condescend
to speak with moderate approbation of &lsquo;Sense and Sensibility,&rsquo;
or &lsquo;Pride and Prejudice&rsquo;; but if they had known that we,
in <!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>our
secret thoughts, classed her with Madame D&rsquo;Arblay or Miss Edgeworth,
or even with some other novel writers of the day whose names are now
scarcely remembered, they would have considered it an amusing instance
of family conceit.&nbsp; To the multitude her works appeared tame and
commonplace, <a name="citation136a"></a><a href="#footnote136a">{136a}</a>
poor in colouring, and sadly deficient in incident and interest.&nbsp;
It is true that we were sometimes cheered by hearing that a different
verdict had been pronounced by more competent judges: we were told how
some great statesman or distinguished poet held these works in high
estimation; we had the satisfaction of believing that they were most
admired by the best judges, and comforted ourselves with Horace&rsquo;s
&lsquo;satis est Equitem mihi plaudere.&rsquo;&nbsp; So much was this
the case, that one of the ablest men of my acquaintance <a name="citation136b"></a><a href="#footnote136b">{136b}</a>
said, in that kind of jest which has much earnest in it, that he had
established it in his own mind, as a new test of ability, whether people
<i>could</i> or <i>could not</i> appreciate Miss Austen&rsquo;s merits.</p>
<p><!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>But
though such golden opinions were now and then gathered in, yet the wide
field of public taste yielded no adequate return either in praise or
profit.&nbsp; Her reward was not to be the quick return of the cornfield,
but the slow growth of the tree which is to endure to another generation.&nbsp;
Her first attempts at publication were very discouraging.&nbsp; In November,
1797, her father wrote the following letter to Mr. Cadell:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Sir,&mdash;I have in my possession a manuscript
novel, comprising 3 vols., about the length of Miss Burney&rsquo;s &ldquo;Evelina.&rdquo;&nbsp;
As I am well aware of what consequence it is that a work of this sort
shd make its first appearance under a respectable name, I apply to you.&nbsp;
I shall be much obliged therefore if you will inform me whether you
choose to be concerned in it, what will be the expense of publishing
it at the author&rsquo;s risk, and what you will venture to advance
for the property of it, if on perusal it is approved of.&nbsp; Should
you give any encouragement, I will send you the work.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am, Sir, your humble Servant,<br />
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">George Austen</span>.&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;Steventon, near Overton, Hants,<br />
&lsquo;1st Nov. 1797.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This proposal was declined by return of post!&nbsp; The work thus
summarily rejected must have been &lsquo;Pride and Prejudice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The fate of &lsquo;Northanger Abbey&rsquo; was still more <!-- page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>humiliating.&nbsp;
It was sold, in 1803, to a publisher in Bath, for ten pounds, but it
found so little favour in his eyes, that he chose to abide by his first
loss rather than risk farther expense by publishing such a work.&nbsp;
It seems to have lain for many years unnoticed in his drawers; somewhat
as the first chapters of &lsquo;Waverley&rsquo; lurked forgotten amongst
the old fishing-tackle in Scott&rsquo;s cabinet.&nbsp; Tilneys, Thorpes,
and Morlands consigned apparently to eternal oblivion!&nbsp; But when
four novels of steadily increasing success had given the writer some
confidence in herself, she wished to recover the copyright of this early
work.&nbsp; One of her brothers undertook the negotiation.&nbsp; He
found the purchaser very willing to receive back his money, and to resign
all claim to the copyright.&nbsp; When the bargain was concluded and
the money paid, but not till then, the negotiator had the satisfaction
of informing him that the work which had been so lightly esteemed was
by the author of &lsquo;Pride and Prejudice.&rsquo;&nbsp; I do not think
that she was herself much mortified by the want of early success.&nbsp;
She wrote for her own amusement.&nbsp; Money, though acceptable, was
not necessary for the moderate expenses of her quiet home.&nbsp; Above
all, she was blessed with a cheerful contented disposition, and an humble
mind; and so lowly did she esteem her own claims, that when she received
150<i>l</i>. from the sale of &lsquo;Sense and Sensibility,&rsquo; she
considered it a prodigious recompense for that which had cost her nothing.&nbsp;
It <!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>cannot
be supposed, however, that she was altogether insensible to the superiority
of her own workmanship over that of some contemporaries who were then
enjoying a brief popularity.&nbsp; Indeed a few touches in the following
extracts from two of her letters show that she was as quicksighted to
absurdities in composition as to those in living persons.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Mr. C.&rsquo;s opinion is gone down in my list;
but as my paper relates only to &ldquo;Mansfield Park,&rdquo; I may
fortunately excuse myself from entering Mr. D&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I will
redeem my credit with him by writing a close imitation of &ldquo;Self-Control,&rdquo;
as soon as I can.&nbsp; I will improve upon it.&nbsp; My heroine shall
not only be wafted down an American river in a boat by herself.&nbsp;
She shall cross the Atlantic in the same way; and never stop till she
reaches Gravesend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have got &ldquo;Rosanne&rdquo; in our Society, and find
it much as you describe it; very good and clever, but tedious.&nbsp;
Mrs. Hawkins&rsquo; great excellence is on serious subjects.&nbsp; There
are some very delightful conversations and reflections on religion:
but on lighter topics I think she falls into many absurdities; and,
as to love, her heroine has very comical feelings.&nbsp; There are a
thousand improbabilities in the story.&nbsp; Do you remember the two
Miss Ormsdens introduced just at last?&nbsp; Very flat and unnatural.&nbsp;
Madelle. Cossart is rather my passion.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two notices of her works appeared in the &lsquo;Quarterly Review.&rsquo;&nbsp;
One in October 1815, and another, more than three years after her death,
in <!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>January
1821.&nbsp; The latter article is known to have been from the pen of
Whately, afterwards Archbishop of Dublin. <a name="citation140"></a><a href="#footnote140">{140}</a>&nbsp;
They differ much from each other in the degree of praise which they
award, and I think also it may be said, in the ability with which they
are written.&nbsp; The first bestows some approval, but the other expresses
the warmest admiration.&nbsp; One can scarcely be satisfied with the
critical acumen of the former writer, who, in treating of &lsquo;Sense
and Sensibility,&rsquo; takes no notice whatever of the vigour with
which many of the characters are drawn, but declares that &lsquo;the
interest and <i>merit</i> of the piece depends <i>altogether</i> upon
the behaviour of the elder sister!&rsquo;&nbsp; Nor is he fair when,
in &lsquo;Pride and Prejudice,&rsquo; he represents Elizabeth&rsquo;s
change of sentiments towards Darcy as caused by the sight of his house
and grounds.&nbsp; But the chief discrepancy between the two reviewers
is to be found in their appreciation of the commonplace and silly characters
to be found in these novels.&nbsp; On this point the difference almost
amounts to a contradiction, such as one sometimes sees drawn up in parallel
columns, when it is desired to convict some writer or some <!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>statesman
of inconsistency.&nbsp; The Reviewer, in 1815, says: &lsquo;The faults
of these works arise from the minute detail which the author&rsquo;s
plan comprehends.&nbsp; Characters of folly or simplicity, such as those
of old Woodhouse and Miss Bates, are ridiculous when first presented,
but if too often brought forward, or too long dwelt on, their prosing
is apt to become as tiresome in fiction as in real society.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The Reviewer, in 1821, on the contrary, singles out the fools as especial
instances of the writer&rsquo;s abilities, and declares that in this
respect she shows a regard to character hardly exceeded by Shakspeare
himself.&nbsp; These are his words: &lsquo;Like him (Shakspeare) she
shows as admirable a discrimination in the character of fools as of
people of sense; a merit which is far from common.&nbsp; To invent indeed
a conversation full of wisdom or of wit requires that the writer should
himself possess ability; but the converse does not hold good, it is
no fool that can describe fools well; and many who have succeeded pretty
well in painting superior characters have failed in giving individuality
to those weaker ones which it is necessary to introduce in order to
give a faithful representation of real life: they exhibit to us mere
folly in the abstract, forgetting that to the eye of the skilful naturalist
the insects on a leaf present as wide differences as exist between the
lion and the elephant.&nbsp; Slender, and Shallow, and Aguecheek, as
Shakspeare has painted them, though equally fools, resemble one another
<!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>no
more than Richard, and Macbeth, and Julius C&aelig;sar; and Miss Austen&rsquo;s
<a name="citation142"></a><a href="#footnote142">{142}</a> Mrs. Bennet,
Mr. Rushworth, and Miss Bates are no more alike than her Darcy, Knightley,
and Edmund Bertram.&nbsp; Some have complained indeed of finding her
fools too much like nature, and consequently tiresome.&nbsp; There is
no disputing about tastes; all we can say is, that such critics must
(whatever deference they may outwardly pay to received opinions) find
the &ldquo;Merry Wives of Windsor&rdquo; and &ldquo;Twelfth Night&rdquo;
very tiresome; and that those who look with pleasure at Wilkie&rsquo;s
pictures, or those of the Dutch school, must admit that excellence of
imitation may confer attraction on that which would be insipid or disagreeable
in the reality.&nbsp; Her minuteness of detail has also been found fault
with; but even where it produces, at the time, a degree of tediousness,
we know not whether that can justly be reckoned a blemish, which is
absolutely essential to a very high excellence.&nbsp; Now it is absolutely
impossible, without this, to produce that thorough acquaintance with
the characters which is necessary to make the reader heartily interested
in them.&nbsp; Let any one cut out from the &ldquo;Iliad&rdquo; or from
Shakspeare&rsquo;s plays everything (we are far from saying that either
might not lose some parts with advantage, but let him reject everything)
which is absolutely devoid of importance and interest <i>in</i> <!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span><i>itself</i>;
and he will find that what is left will have lost more than half its
charms.&nbsp; We are convinced that some writers have diminished the
effect of their works by being scrupulous to admit nothing into them
which had not some absolute and independent merit.&nbsp; They have acted
like those who strip off the leaves of a fruit tree, as being of themselves
good for nothing, with the view of securing more nourishment to the
fruit, which in fact cannot attain its full maturity and flavour without
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The world, I think, has endorsed the opinion of the later writer;
but it would not be fair to set down the discrepancy between the two
entirely to the discredit of the former.&nbsp; The fact is that, in
the course of the intervening five years, these works had been read
and reread by many leaders in the literary world.&nbsp; The public taste
was forming itself all this time, and &lsquo;grew by what it fed on.&rsquo;&nbsp;
These novels belong to a class which gain rather than lose by frequent
perusals, and it is probable that each Reviewer represented fairly enough
the prevailing opinions of readers in the year when each wrote.</p>
<p>Since that time, the testimonies in favour of Jane Austen&rsquo;s
works have been continual and almost unanimous.&nbsp; They are frequently
referred to as models; nor have they lost their first distinction of
being especially acceptable to minds of the highest order.&nbsp; I shall
indulge myself by collecting into the next chapter instances of the
homage paid to her by such persons.</p>
<h2><!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>CHAPTER
IX.</h2>
<p><i>Opinions expressed by eminent persons&mdash;Opinions of others
of less eminence&mdash;Opinion of American readers</i>.</p>
<p>Into this list of the admirers of my Aunt&rsquo;s works, I admit
those only whose eminence will be universally acknowledged.&nbsp; No
doubt the number might have been increased.</p>
<p>Southey, in a letter to Sir Egerton Brydges, says: &lsquo;You mention
Miss Austen.&nbsp; Her novels are more true to nature, and have, for
my sympathies, passages of finer feeling than any others of this age.&nbsp;
She was a person of whom I have heard so well and think so highly, that
I regret not having had an opportunity of testifying to her the respect
which I felt for her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It may be observed that Southey had probably heard from his own family
connections of the charm of her private character.&nbsp; A friend of
hers, the daughter of Mr. Bigge Wither, of Manydown Park near Basingstoke,
was married to Southey&rsquo;s uncle, the Rev. Herbert Hill, who had
been useful to his nephew in many ways, and especially in supplying
him with the means of attaining his extensive knowledge of Spanish and
Portuguese literature.&nbsp; Mr. Hill had been Chaplain to the British
Factory <!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>at
Lisbon, where Southey visited him and had the use of a library in those
languages which his uncle had collected.&nbsp; Southey himself continually
mentions his uncle Hill in terms of respect and gratitude.</p>
<p>S. T. Coleridge would sometimes burst out into high encomiums of
Miss Austen&rsquo;s novels as being, &lsquo;in their way, perfectly
genuine and individual productions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I remember Miss Mitford&rsquo;s saying to me: &lsquo;I would almost
cut off one of my hands, if it would enable me to write like your aunt
with the other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The biographer of Sir J. Mackintosh says: &lsquo;Something recalled
to his mind the traits of character which are so delicately touched
in Miss Austen&rsquo;s novels . . .&nbsp; He said that there was genius
in sketching out that new kind of novel . . .&nbsp; He was vexed for
the credit of the &ldquo;Edinburgh Review&rdquo; that it had left her
unnoticed .<a name="citation145"></a><a href="#footnote145">{145}</a>
. .&nbsp; The &ldquo;Quarterly&rdquo; had done her more justice . .
.&nbsp; It was impossible for a foreigner to understand fully the merit
of her works.&nbsp; Madame de Sta&euml;l, to whom he had recommended
one of her novels, found no interest in it; and in her note to him in
reply said it was &ldquo;vulgaire&rdquo;: and yet, he said, nothing
could be more true than what he wrote in answer: &ldquo;There is no
book which that word would so little suit.&rdquo; . . .&nbsp; Every
village could furnish matter for a novel to Miss Austen.&nbsp; She did
not need the common <!-- page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>materials
for a novel, strong emotions, or strong incidents.&rsquo; <a name="citation146"></a><a href="#footnote146">{146}</a></p>
<p>It was not, however, quite impossible for a foreigner to appreciate
these works; for Mons. Guizot writes thus: &lsquo;I am a great novel
reader, but I seldom read German or French novels.&nbsp; The characters
are too artificial.&nbsp; My delight is to read English novels, particularly
those written by women.&nbsp; &ldquo;C&rsquo;est toute une &eacute;cole
de morale.&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss Austen, Miss Ferrier, &amp;c., form a school
which in the excellence and profusion of its productions resembles the
cloud of dramatic poets of the great Athenian age.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the &lsquo;Keepsake&rsquo; of 1825 the following lines appeared,
written by Lord Morpeth, afterwards seventh Earl of Carlisle, and Lord-Lieutenant
of Ireland, accompanying an illustration of a lady reading a novel.</p>
<blockquote><p>Beats thy quick pulse o&rsquo;er Inchbald&rsquo;s thrilling
leaf,<br />
Brunton&rsquo;s high moral, Opie&rsquo;s deep wrought grief?<br />
Has the mild chaperon claimed thy yielding heart,<br />
Carroll&rsquo;s dark page, Trevelyan&rsquo;s gentle art?<br />
Or is it thou, all perfect Austen?&nbsp; Here<br />
Let one poor wreath adorn thy early bier,<br />
That scarce allowed thy modest youth to claim<br />
Its living portion of thy certain fame!<br />
Oh! Mrs. Bennet!&nbsp; Mrs. Norris too!<br />
While memory survives we&rsquo;ll dream of you.<br />
And Mr. Woodhouse, whose abstemious lip<br />
Must thin, but not too thin, his gruel sip.<br />
<!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>Miss
Bates, our idol, though the village bore;<br />
And Mrs. Elton, ardent to explore.<br />
While the clear style flows on without pretence,<br />
With unstained purity, and unmatched sense:<br />
Or, if a sister e&rsquo;er approached the throne,<br />
She called the rich &lsquo;inheritance&rsquo; her own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The admiration felt by Lord Macaulay would probably have taken a
very practical form, if his life had been prolonged.&nbsp; I have the
authority of his sister, Lady Trevelyan, for stating that he had intended
to undertake the task upon which I have ventured.&nbsp; He purposed
to write a memoir of Miss Austen, with criticisms on her works, to prefix
it to a new edition of her novels, and from the proceeds of the sale
to erect a monument to her memory in Winchester Cathedral.&nbsp; Oh!
that such an idea had been realised!&nbsp; That portion of the plan
in which Lord Macaulay&rsquo;s success would have been most certain
might have been almost sufficient for his object.&nbsp; A memoir written
by him would have been a monument.</p>
<p>I am kindly permitted by Sir Henry Holland to give the following
quotation from his printed but unpublished recollections of his past
life:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I have the picture still before me of Lord Holland
lying on his bed, when attacked with gout, his admirable sister, Miss
Fox, beside him reading aloud, as she always did on these occasions,
some one of Miss Austen&rsquo;s novels, of which he was never wearied.&nbsp;
I well recollect the time when these charming novels, almost unique
in their style of <!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>humour,
burst suddenly on the world.&nbsp; It was sad that their writer did
not live to witness the growth of her fame.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My brother-in-law, Sir Denis Le Marchant, has supplied me with the
following anecdotes from his own recollections:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;When I was a student at Trinity College, Cambridge,
Mr. Whewell, then a Fellow and afterwards Master of the College, often
spoke to me with admiration of Miss Austen&rsquo;s novels.&nbsp; On
one occasion I said that I had found &ldquo;Persuasion&rdquo; rather
dull.&nbsp; He quite fired up in defence of it, insisting that it was
the most beautiful of her works.&nbsp; This accomplished philosopher
was deeply versed in works of fiction.&nbsp; I recollect his writing
to me from Caernarvon, where he had the charge of some pupils, that
he was weary of <i>his</i> stay, for he had read the circulating library
twice through.</p>
<p>&lsquo;During a visit I paid to Lord Lansdowne, at Bowood, in 1846,
one of Miss Austen&rsquo;s novels became the subject of conversation
and of praise, especially from Lord Lansdowne, who observed that one
of the circumstances of his life which he looked back upon with vexation
was that Miss Austen should once have been living some weeks in his
neighbourhood without his knowing it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have heard Sydney Smith, more than once, dwell with eloquence
on the merits of Miss Austen&rsquo;s novels.&nbsp; He told me he should
have enjoyed giving <!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>her
the pleasure of reading her praises in the &ldquo;Edinburgh Review.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Fanny Price&rdquo; was one of his prime favourites.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I close this list of testimonies, this long &lsquo;Catena Patrum,&rsquo;
with the remarkable words of Sir Walter Scott, taken from his diary
for March 14, 1826: <a name="citation149"></a><a href="#footnote149">{149}</a>&nbsp;
&lsquo;Read again, for the third time at least, Miss Austen&rsquo;s
finely written novel of &ldquo;Pride and Prejudice.&rdquo;&nbsp; That
young lady had a talent for describing the involvements and feelings
and characters of ordinary life, which is to me the most wonderful I
ever met with.&nbsp; The big Bow-Wow strain I can do myself like any
now going; but the exquisite touch which renders ordinary common-place
things and characters interesting from the truth of the description
and the sentiment is denied to me.&nbsp; What a pity such a gifted creature
died so early!&rsquo;&nbsp; The well-worn condition of Scott&rsquo;s
own copy of these works attests that they were much read in his family.&nbsp;
When I visited Abbotsford, a few years after Scott&rsquo;s death, I
was permitted, as an unusual favour, to take one of these volumes in
my hands.&nbsp; One cannot suppress the wish that she had lived to know
what such men thought of her powers, and how gladly they would have
cultivated a personal acquaintance with her.&nbsp; I do not think that
it would at all have impaired the modest simplicity of her character;
or that we should have lost <!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>our
own dear &lsquo;Aunt Jane&rsquo; in the blaze of literary fame.</p>
<p>It may be amusing to contrast with these testimonies from the great,
the opinions expressed by other readers of more ordinary intellect.&nbsp;
The author herself has left a list of criticisms which it had been her
amusement to collect, through means of her friends.&nbsp; This list
contains much of warm-hearted sympathising praise, interspersed with
some opinions which may be considered surprising.</p>
<p>One lady could say nothing better of &lsquo;Mansfield Park,&rsquo;
than that it was &lsquo;a mere novel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another owned that she thought &lsquo;Sense and Sensibility&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Pride and Prejudice&rsquo; downright nonsense; but expected
to like &lsquo;Mansfield Park&rsquo; better, and having finished the
first volume, hoped that she had got through the worst.</p>
<p>Another did not like &lsquo;Mansfield Park.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nothing
interesting in the characters.&nbsp; Language poor.</p>
<p>One gentleman read the first and last chapters of &lsquo;Emma,&rsquo;
but did not look at the rest because he had been told that it was not
interesting.</p>
<p>The opinions of another gentleman about &lsquo;Emma&rsquo; were so
bad that they could not be reported to the author.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quot homines, tot sententi&aelig;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thirty-five years after her death there came also a voice of praise
from across the Atlantic.&nbsp; In 1852 the following letter was received
by her brother Sir Francis Austen:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>&lsquo;Boston,
Massachusetts, U.S.A.</p>
<p>6th Jan. 1852.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Since high critical authority has pronounced the delineations
of character in the works of Jane Austen second only to those of Shakspeare,
transatlantic admiration appears superfluous; yet it may not be uninteresting
to her family to receive an assurance that the influence of her genius
is extensively recognised in the American Republic, even by the highest
judicial authorities.&nbsp; The late Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, of
the supreme Court of the United States, and his associate Mr. Justice
Story, highly estimated and admired Miss Austen, and to them we owe
our introduction to her society.&nbsp; For many years her talents have
brightened our daily path, and her name and those of her characters
are familiar to us as &ldquo;household words.&rdquo;&nbsp; We have long
wished to express to some of her family the sentiments of gratitude
and affection she has inspired, and request more information relative
to her life than is given in the brief memoir prefixed to her works.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Having accidentally heard that a brother of Jane Austen held
a high rank in the British Navy, we have obtained his address from our
friend Admiral Wormley, now resident in Boston, and we trust this expression
of our feeling will be received by her relations with the kindness and
urbanity characteristic of Admirals of <i>her creation</i>.&nbsp; Sir
Francis Austen, or one of his family, would confer <!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>a
great favour by complying with our request.&nbsp; The autograph of his
sister, or a few lines in her handwriting, would be placed among our
chief treasures.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The family who delight in the companionship of Jane Austen,
and who present this petition, are of English origin.&nbsp; Their ancestor
held a high rank among the first emigrants to New England, and his name
and character have been ably represented by his descendants in various
public stations of trust and responsibility to the present time in the
colony and state of Massachusetts.&nbsp; A letter addressed to Miss
Quincey, care of the Honble Josiah Quincey, Boston, Massachusetts, would
reach its destination.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sir Francis Austen returned a suitable reply to this application;
and sent a long letter of his sister&rsquo;s, which, no doubt, still
occupies the place of honour promised by the Quincey family.</p>

<p><i>Observations on the Novels</i>.</p>
<p>It is not the object of these memoirs to attempt a criticism on Jane
Austen&rsquo;s novels.&nbsp; Those particulars only have been noticed
which could be illustrated by the circumstances of her own life; but
I now desire to offer a few observations on them, and especially on
one point, on which my age renders me a competent witness&mdash;the
fidelity with which they represent the opinions and manners of the class
of society in which the author lived early in this century.&nbsp; They
do this the more faithfully on account of the very deficiency with which
they have been sometimes charged&mdash;namely, that they make no attempt
to raise the standard of human life, but merely represent it as it was.&nbsp;
They certainly were not written to support any theory or inculcate any
particular moral, except indeed the great moral which is to be equally
gathered from an observation of the course of actual life&mdash;namely,
the superiority of high over low principles, and of greatness over littleness
of mind.&nbsp; These writings are like photographs, in which no feature
is softened; no ideal expression is introduced, all is the unadorned
reflection of the natural object; and the value of <!-- page 154--><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>such
a faithful likeness must increase as time gradually works more and more
changes in the face of society itself.&nbsp; A remarkable instance of
this is to be found in her portraiture of the clergy.&nbsp; She was
the daughter and the sister of clergymen, who certainly were not low
specimens of their order: and she has chosen three of her heroes from
that profession; but no one in these days can think that either Edmund
Bertram or Henry Tilney had adequate ideas of the duties of a parish
minister.&nbsp; Such, however, were the opinions and practice then prevalent
among respectable and conscientious clergymen before their minds had
been stirred, first by the Evangelical, and afterwards by the High Church
movement which this century has witnessed.&nbsp; The country may be
congratulated which, on looking back to such a fixed landmark, can find
that it has been advancing instead of receding from it.</p>
<p>The long interval that elapsed between the completion of &lsquo;Northanger
Abbey&rsquo; in 1798, and the commencement of &lsquo;Mansfield Park&rsquo;
in 1811, may sufficiently account for any difference of style which
may be perceived between her three earlier and her three later productions.&nbsp;
If the former showed quite as much originality and genius, they may
perhaps be thought to have less of the faultless finish and high polish
which distinguish the latter.&nbsp; The characters of the John Dashwoods,
Mr. Collins, and the Thorpes stand out from the canvas with a vigour
and originality which cannot be surpassed; <!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>but
I think that in her last three works are to be found a greater refinement
of taste, a more nice sense of propriety, and a deeper insight into
the delicate anatomy of the human heart, marking the difference between
the brilliant girl and the mature woman.&nbsp; Far from being one of
those who have over-written themselves, it may be affirmed that her
fame would have stood on a narrower and less firm basis, if she had
not lived to resume her pen at Chawton.</p>
<p>Some persons have surmised that she took her characters from individuals
with whom she had been acquainted.&nbsp; They were so life-like that
it was assumed that they must once have lived, and have been transferred
bodily, as it were, into her pages.&nbsp; But surely such a supposition
betrays an ignorance of the high prerogative of genius to create out
of its own resources imaginary characters, who shall be true to nature
and consistent in themselves.&nbsp; Perhaps, however, the distinction
between keeping true to nature and servilely copying any one specimen
of it is not always clearly apprehended.&nbsp; It is indeed true, both
of the writer and of the painter, that he can use only such lineaments
as exist, and as he has observed to exist, in living objects; otherwise
he would produce monsters instead of human beings; but in both it is
the office of high art to mould these features into new combinations,
and to place them in the attitudes, and impart to them the expressions
which may suit the purposes <!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>of
the artist; so that they are nature, but not exactly the same nature
which had come before his eyes; just as honey can be obtained only from
the natural flowers which the bee has sucked; yet it is not a reproduction
of the odour or flavour of any particular flower, but becomes something
different when it has gone through the process of transformation which
that little insect is able to effect.&nbsp; Hence, in the case of painters,
arises the superiority of original compositions over portrait painting.&nbsp;
Reynolds was exercising a higher faculty when he designed Comedy and
Tragedy contending for Garrick, than when he merely took a likeness
of that actor.&nbsp; The same difference exists in writings between
the original conceptions of Shakspeare and some other creative geniuses,
and such full-length likenesses of individual persons, &lsquo;The Talking
Gentleman&rsquo; for instance, as are admirably drawn by Miss Mitford.&nbsp;
Jane Austen&rsquo;s powers, whatever may be the degree in which she
possessed them, were certainly of that higher order.&nbsp; She did not
copy individuals, but she invested her own creations with individuality
of character.&nbsp; A reviewer in the &lsquo;Quarterly&rsquo; speaks
of an acquaintance who, ever since the publication of &lsquo;Pride and
Prejudice,&rsquo; had been called by his friends Mr. Bennet, but the
author did not know him.&nbsp; Her own relations never recognised any
individual in her characters; and I can call to mind several of her
acquaintance whose peculiarities were very tempting and easy to be <!-- page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>caricatured
of whom there are no traces in her pages.&nbsp; She herself, when questioned
on the subject by a friend, expressed a dread of what she called such
an &lsquo;invasion of social proprieties.&rsquo;&nbsp; She said that
she thought it quite fair to note peculiarities and weaknesses, but
that it was her desire to create, not to reproduce; &lsquo;besides,&rsquo;
she added, &lsquo;I am too proud of my gentlemen to admit that they
were only Mr. A. or Colonel B.&rsquo;&nbsp; She did not, however, suppose
that her imaginary characters were of a higher order than are to be
found in nature; for she said, when speaking of two of her great favourites,
Edmund Bertram and Mr. Knightley: &lsquo;They are very far from being
what I know English gentlemen often are.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She certainly took a kind of parental interest in the beings whom
she had created, and did not dismiss them from her thoughts when she
had finished her last chapter.&nbsp; We have seen, in one of her letters,
her personal affection for Darcy and Elizabeth; and when sending a copy
of &lsquo;Emma&rsquo; to a friend whose daughter had been lately born,
she wrote thus: &lsquo;I trust you will be as glad to see my &ldquo;Emma,&rdquo;
as I shall be to see your Jemima.&rsquo;&nbsp; She was very fond of
Emma, but did not reckon on her being a general favourite; for, when
commencing that work, she said, &lsquo;I am going to take a heroine
whom no one but myself will much like.&rsquo;&nbsp; She would, if asked,
tell us many little particulars about the subsequent career of some
of her people.&nbsp; In this traditionary way we <!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>learned
that Miss Steele never succeeded in catching the Doctor; that Kitty
Bennet was satisfactorily married to a clergyman near Pemberley, while
Mary obtained nothing higher than one of her uncle Philip&rsquo;s clerks,
and was content to be considered a star in the society of Meriton; that
the &lsquo;considerable sum&rsquo; given by Mrs. Norris to William Price
was one pound; that Mr. Woodhouse survived his daughter&rsquo;s marriage,
and kept her and Mr. Knightley from settling at Donwell, about two years;
and that the letters placed by Frank Churchill before Jane Fairfax,
which she swept away unread, contained the word &lsquo;pardon.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Of the good people in &lsquo;Northanger Abbey&rsquo; and &lsquo;Persuasion&rsquo;
we know nothing more than what is written: for before those works were
published their author had been taken away from us, and all such amusing
communications had ceased for ever.</p>

XI.</h2>
<p><i>Declining health of Jane Austen&mdash;Elasticity of her spirits&mdash;Her
resignation and humility&mdash;Her death</i>.</p>
<p>Early in the year 1816 some family troubles disturbed the usually
tranquil course of Jane Austen&rsquo;s life; and it is probable that
the inward malady, which was to prove ultimately fatal, was already
felt by her; for some distant friends, <a name="citation159"></a><a href="#footnote159">{159}</a>
whom she visited in the spring of that year, thought that her health
was somewhat impaired, and observed that she went about her old haunts,
and recalled old recollections connected with them in a particular manner,
as if she did not expect ever to see them again.&nbsp; It is not surprising
that, under these circumstances, some of her letters were of a graver
tone than had been customary with her, and expressed resignation rather
than cheerfulness.&nbsp; In reference to these troubles in a letter
to her brother Charles, after mentioning that she had been laid up with
an attack of bilious fever, she says: &lsquo;I live up stairs for the
present and am coddled.&nbsp; I am the only one of the party who has
been so silly, but a weak body must excuse weak nerves.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And again, to another correspondent: &lsquo;But I am getting too near
<!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>complaint;
it has been the appointment of God, however secondary causes may have
operated.&rsquo;&nbsp; But the elasticity of her spirits soon recovered
their tone.&nbsp; It was in the latter half of that year that she addressed
the two following lively letters to a nephew, one while he was at Winchester
School, the other soon after he had left it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Chawton, July 9, 1816.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear E.</span>&mdash;Many thanks.&nbsp;
A thank for every line, and as many to Mr. W. Digweed for coming.&nbsp;
We have been wanting very much to hear of your mother, and are happy
to find she continues to mend, but her illness must have been a very
serious one indeed.&nbsp; When she is really recovered, she ought to
try change of air, and come over to us.&nbsp; Tell your father that
I am very much obliged to him for his share of your letter, and most
sincerely join in the hope of her being eventually much the better for
her present discipline.&nbsp; She has the comfort moreover of being
confined in such weather as gives one little temptation to be out.&nbsp;
It is really too bad, and has been too bad for a long time, much worse
than any one can bear, and I begin to think it will never be fine again.&nbsp;
This is a <i>finesse</i> of mine, for I have often observed that if
one writes about the weather, it is generally completely changed before
the letter is read.&nbsp; I wish it may prove so now, and that when
Mr. W. Digweed reaches Steventon to-morrow, he may find you have had
a long series of hot dry <!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>weather.&nbsp;
We are a small party at present, only grandmamma, Mary Jane, and myself.&nbsp;
Yalden&rsquo;s coach cleared off the rest yesterday.&nbsp; I am glad
you recollected to mention your being come home. <a name="citation161a"></a><a href="#footnote161a">{161a}</a>&nbsp;
My heart began to sink within me when I had got so far through your
letter without its being mentioned.&nbsp; I was dreadfully afraid that
you might be detained at Winchester by severe illness, confined to your
bed perhaps, and quite unable to hold a pen, and only dating from Steventon
in order, with a mistaken sort of tenderness, to deceive me.&nbsp; But
now I have no doubt of your being at home.&nbsp; I am sure you would
not say it so seriously unless it actually were so.&nbsp; We saw a countless
number of post-chaises full of boys pass by yesterday morning <a name="citation161b"></a><a href="#footnote161b">{161b}</a>&mdash;full
of future heroes, legislators, fools, and villains.&nbsp; You have never
thanked me for my last letter, which went by the cheese.&nbsp; I cannot
bear not to be thanked.&nbsp; You will not pay us a visit yet of course;
we must not think of it.&nbsp; Your mother must get well first, and
you must go to Oxford and <i>not</i> be elected; after that a little
change of scene may be good for you, and your physicians I hope will
order you to the sea, or to a house by the side of a very considerable
pond. <a name="citation161c"></a><a href="#footnote161c">{161c}</a>&nbsp;
Oh! it rains again.&nbsp; It beats against the <!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>window.&nbsp;
Mary Jane and I have been wet through once already to-day; we set off
in the donkey-carriage for Farringdon, as I wanted to see the improvement
Mr. Woolls is making, but we were obliged to turn back before we got
there, but not soon enough to avoid a pelter all the way home.&nbsp;
We met Mr. Woolls.&nbsp; I talked of its being bad weather for the hay,
and he returned me the comfort of its being much worse for the wheat.&nbsp;
We hear that Mrs. S. does not quit Tangier: why and wherefore?&nbsp;
Do you know that our Browning is gone?&nbsp; You must prepare for a
William when you come, a good-looking lad, civil and quiet, and seeming
likely to do.&nbsp; Good bye.&nbsp; I am sure Mr. W. D. <a name="citation162"></a><a href="#footnote162">{162}</a>
will be astonished at my writing so much, for the paper is so thin that
he will be able to count the lines if not to read them.</p>
<p>Yours affec<sup>ly</sup>,<br />
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Jane Austen</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the next letter will be found her description of her own style
of composition, which has already appeared in the notice prefixed to
&lsquo;Northanger Abbey&rsquo; and &lsquo;Persuasion&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Chawton, Monday, Dec. 16th (1816).</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear E.</span>,&mdash;One reason for
my writing to you now is, that I may have the pleasure of directing
to you Esq<sup>re</sup>.&nbsp; I give you joy of having left Winchester.&nbsp;
<!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>Now
you may own how miserable you were there; now it will gradually all
come out, your crimes and your miseries&mdash;how often you went up
by the Mail to London and threw away fifty guineas at a tavern, and
how often you were on the point of hanging yourself, restrained only,
as some ill-natured aspersion upon poor old Winton has it, by the want
of a tree within some miles of the city.&nbsp; Charles Knight and his
companions passed through Chawton about 9 this morning; later than it
used to be.&nbsp; Uncle Henry and I had a glimpse of his handsome face,
looking all health and good humour.&nbsp; I wonder when you will come
and see us.&nbsp; I know what I rather speculate upon, but shall say
nothing.&nbsp; We think uncle Henry in excellent looks.&nbsp; Look at
him this moment, and think so too, if you have not done it before; and
we have the great comfort of seeing decided improvement in uncle Charles,
both as to health, spirits, and appearance.&nbsp; And they are each
of them so agreeable in their different way, and harmonise so well,
that their visit is thorough enjoyment.&nbsp; Uncle Henry writes very
superior sermons.&nbsp; You and I must try to get hold of one or two,
and put them into our novels: it would be a fine help to a volume; and
we could make our heroine read it aloud on a Sunday evening, just as
well as Isabella Wardour, in the &ldquo;Antiquary,&rdquo; is made to
read the &ldquo;History of the Hartz Demon&rdquo; in the ruins of St.
Ruth, though I believe, on recollection, Lovell is the reader.&nbsp;
By the bye, my <!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>dear
E., I am quite concerned for the loss your mother mentions in her letter.&nbsp;
Two chapters and a half to be missing is monstrous!&nbsp; It is well
that <i>I</i> have not been at Steventon lately, and therefore cannot
be suspected of purloining them: two strong twigs and a half towards
a nest of my own would have been something.&nbsp; I do not think, however,
that any theft of that sort would be really very useful to me.&nbsp;
What should I do with your strong, manly, vigorous sketches, full of
variety and glow?&nbsp; How could I possibly join them on to the little
bit (two inches wide) of ivory on which I work with so fine a brush,
as produces little effect after much labour?</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will hear from uncle Henry how well Anna is.&nbsp; She
seems perfectly recovered.&nbsp; Ben was here on Saturday, to ask uncle
Charles and me to dine with them, as to-morrow, but I was forced to
decline it, the walk is beyond my strength (though I am otherwise very
well), and this is not a season for donkey-carriages; and as we do not
like to spare uncle Charles, he has declined it too.</p>
<p><i>Tuesday</i>.&nbsp; Ah, ah! Mr. E.&nbsp; I doubt your seeing uncle
Henry at Steventon to-day.&nbsp; The weather will prevent your expecting
him, I think.&nbsp; Tell your father, with aunt Cass&rsquo;s love and
mine, that the pickled cucumbers are extremely good, and tell him also&mdash;&ldquo;tell
him what you will.&rdquo;&nbsp; No, don&rsquo;t tell him what you will,
but tell him that grandmamma begs him to make Joseph Hall pay his rent,
if he can.</p>
<p><!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>
&lsquo;You must not be tired of reading the word <i>uncle</i>, for I
have not done with it.&nbsp; Uncle Charles thanks your mother for her
letter; it was a great pleasure to him to know that the parcel was received
and gave so much satisfaction, and he begs her to be so good as to give
three shillings for him to Dame Staples, which shall be allowed for
in the payment of her debt here.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Adieu, Amiable!&nbsp; I hope Caroline behaves well to you.</p>
<p>Yours affec<sup>ly</sup>,<br />
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">J. Austen</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I cannot tell how soon she was aware of the serious nature of her
malady.&nbsp; By God&rsquo;s mercy it was not attended with much suffering;
so that she was able to tell her friends as in the foregoing letter,
and perhaps sometimes to persuade herself that, excepting want of strength,
she was &lsquo;otherwise very well;&rsquo; but the progress of the disease
became more and more manifest as the year advanced.&nbsp; The usual
walk was at first shortened, and then discontinued; and air was sought
in a donkey-carriage.&nbsp; Gradually, too, her habits of activity within
the house ceased, and she was obliged to lie down much.&nbsp; The sitting-room
contained only one sofa, which was frequently occupied by her mother,
who was more than seventy years old.&nbsp; Jane would never use it,
even in her mother&rsquo;s absence; but she contrived a sort of couch
for herself with two or <!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>three
chairs, and was pleased to say that this arrangement was more comfortable
to her than a real sofa.&nbsp; Her reasons for this might have been
left to be guessed, but for the importunities of a little niece, which
obliged her to explain that if she herself had shown any inclination
to use the sofa, her mother might have scrupled being on it so much
as was good for her.</p>
<p>It is certain, however, that the mind did not share in this decay
of the bodily strength.&nbsp; &lsquo;Persuasion&rsquo; was not finished
before the middle of August in that year; and the manner in which it
was then completed affords proof that neither the critical nor the creative
powers of the author were at all impaired.&nbsp; The book had been brought
to an end in July; and the re-engagement of the hero and heroine effected
in a totally different manner in a scene laid at Admiral Croft&rsquo;s
lodgings.&nbsp; But her performance did not satisfy her.&nbsp; She thought
it tame and flat, and was desirous of producing something better.&nbsp;
This weighed upon her mind, the more so probably on account of the weak
state of her health; so that one night she retired to rest in very low
spirits.&nbsp; But such depression was little in accordance with her
nature, and was soon shaken off.&nbsp; The next morning she awoke to
more cheerful views and brighter inspirations: the sense of power revived;
and imagination resumed its course.&nbsp; She cancelled the condemned
chapter, and wrote two others, entirely different, in its stead.&nbsp;
The result is that we <!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>possess
the visit of the Musgrove party to Bath; the crowded and animated scenes
at the White Hart Hotel; and the charming conversation between Capt.
Harville and Anne Elliot, overheard by Capt. Wentworth, by which the
two faithful lovers were at last led to understand each other&rsquo;s
feelings.&nbsp; The tenth and eleventh chapters of &lsquo;Persuasion&rsquo;
then, rather than the actual winding-up of the story, contain the latest
of her printed compositions, her last contribution to the entertainment
of the public.&nbsp; Perhaps it may be thought that she has seldom written
anything more brilliant; and that, independent of the original manner
in which the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> is brought about, the pictures
of Charles Musgrove&rsquo;s good-natured boyishness and of his wife&rsquo;s
jealous selfishness would have been incomplete without these finishing
strokes.&nbsp; The cancelled chapter exists in manuscript.&nbsp; It
is certainly inferior to the two which were substituted for it: but
it was such as some writers and some readers might have been contented
with; and it contained touches which scarcely any other hand could have
given, the suppression of which may be almost a matter of regret. <a name="citation167"></a><a href="#footnote167">{167}</a></p>
<p>The following letter was addressed to her friend Miss Bigg, then
staying at Streatham with her sister, the wife of the Reverend Herbert
Hill, uncle of Robert Southey.&nbsp; It appears to have been written
<!-- page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>three
days before she began her last work, which will be noticed in another
chapter; and shows that she was not at that time aware of the serious
nature of her malady:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Chawton, January 24, 1817.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear Alethea</span>,&mdash;I think
it time there should be a little writing between us, though I believe
the epistolary debt is on <i>your</i> side, and I hope this will find
all the Streatham party well, neither carried away by the flood, nor
rheumatic through the damps.&nbsp; Such mild weather is, you know, delightful
to <i>us</i>, and though we have a great many ponds, and a fine running
stream through the meadows on the other side of the road, it is nothing
but what beautifies us and does to talk of.&nbsp; <i>I</i> have certainly
gained strength through the winter and am not far from being well; and
I think I understand my own case now so much better than I did, as to
be able by care to keep off any serious return of illness.&nbsp; I am
convinced that <i>bile</i> is at the bottom of all I have suffered,
which makes it easy to know how to treat myself.&nbsp; You will be glad
to hear thus much of me, I am sure.&nbsp; We have just had a few days&rsquo;
visit from Edward, who brought us a good account of his father, and
the very circumstance of his coming at all, of his father&rsquo;s being
able to spare him, is itself a good account.&nbsp; He grows still, and
still improves in appearance, at least in the estimation of his aunts,
who love him better and better, <!-- page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>as
they see the sweet temper and warm affections of the boy confirmed in
the young man: I tried hard to persuade him that he must have some message
for William, <a name="citation169a"></a><a href="#footnote169a">{169a}</a>
but in vain. . . .&nbsp; This is not a time of year for donkey-carriages,
and our donkeys are necessarily having so long a run of luxurious idleness
that I suppose we shall find they have forgotten much of their education
when we use them again.&nbsp; We do not use two at once however; don&rsquo;t
imagine such excesses. . .&nbsp; Our own new clergyman <a name="citation169b"></a><a href="#footnote169b">{169b}</a>
is expected here very soon, perhaps in time to assist Mr. Papillon on
Sunday.&nbsp; I shall be very glad when the first hearing is over.&nbsp;
It will be a nervous hour for our pew, though we hear that he acquits
himself with as much ease and collectedness, as if he had been used
to it all his life.&nbsp; We have no chance we know of seeing you between
Streatham and Winchester: you go the other road and are engaged to two
or three houses; if there should be any change, however, you know how
welcome you would be. . . .&nbsp; We have been reading the &ldquo;Poet&rsquo;s
Pilgrimage to Waterloo,&rdquo; and generally with much approbation.&nbsp;
Nothing will please all the world, you know; but parts of it suit me
better than much that he has written before.&nbsp; The opening&mdash;<i>the
proem</i> I believe he calls it&mdash;is very beautiful.&nbsp; Poor
man! one cannot but grieve for the loss of the son <!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>so
fondly described.&nbsp; Has he at all recovered it?&nbsp; What do Mr.
and Mrs. Hill know about his present state?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yours aff<sup>ly</sup>,<br />

<p>&lsquo;The real object of this letter is to ask you for a receipt,
but I thought it genteel not to let it appear early.&nbsp; We remember
some excellent orange wine at Manydown, made from Seville oranges, entirely
or chiefly.&nbsp; I should be very much obliged to you for the receipt,
if you can command it within a few weeks.&rsquo;</p>

<p>On the day before, January 23rd, she had written to her niece in
the same hopeful tone: &lsquo;I feel myself getting stronger than I
was, and can so perfectly walk <i>to</i> Alton, <i>or</i> back again
without fatigue, that I hope to be able to do <i>both</i> when summer
comes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Alas! summer came to her only on her deathbed.&nbsp; March 17th is
the last date to be found in the manuscript on which she was engaged;
and as the watch of the drowned man indicates the time of his death,
so does this final date seem to fix the period when her mind could no
longer pursue its accustomed course.</p>
<p>And here I cannot do better than quote the words of the niece to
whose private records of her aunt&rsquo;s life and character I have
been so often indebted:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>&lsquo;I
do not know how early the alarming symptoms of her malady came on.&nbsp;
It was in the following March that I had the first idea of her being
seriously ill.&nbsp; It had been settled that about the end of that
month, or the beginning of April, I should spend a few days at Chawton,
in the absence of my father and mother, who were just then engaged with
Mrs. Leigh Perrot in arranging her late husband&rsquo;s affairs; but
Aunt Jane became too ill to have me in the house, and so I went instead
to my sister Mrs. Lefroy at Wyards&rsquo;.&nbsp; The next day we walked
over to Chawton to make enquiries after our aunt.&nbsp; She was then
keeping her room, but said she would see us, and we went up to her.&nbsp;
She was in her dressing gown, and was sitting quite like an invalid
in an arm-chair, but she got up and kindly greeted us, and then, pointing
to seats which had been arranged for us by the fire, she said, &ldquo;There
is a chair for the married lady, and a little stool for you, Caroline.&rdquo;
<a name="citation171"></a><a href="#footnote171">{171}</a>&nbsp; It
is strange, but those trifling words were the last of hers that I can
remember, for I retain no recollection of what was said by anyone in
the conversation that ensued.&nbsp; I was struck by the alteration in
herself.&nbsp; She was very pale, her voice was weak and low, and there
was about her a general appearance of debility and suffering; but I
have been told that she never had much acute pain.&nbsp; She was not
equal to the exertion of talking to us, and our visit to the sick room
was a very short one, Aunt Cassandra soon <!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>taking
us away.&nbsp; I do not suppose we stayed a quarter of an hour; and
I never saw Aunt Jane again.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In May 1817 she was persuaded to remove to Winchester, for the sake
of medical advice from Mr. Lyford.&nbsp; The Lyfords have, for some
generations, maintained a high character in Winchester for medical skill,
and the Mr. Lyford of that day was a man of more than provincial reputation,
in whom great London practitioners expressed confidence.&nbsp; Mr. Lyford
spoke encouragingly.&nbsp; It was not, of course, his business to extinguish
hope in his patient, but I believe that he had, from the first, very
little expectation of a permanent cure.&nbsp; All that was gained by
the removal from home was the satisfaction of having done the best that
could be done, together with such alleviations of suffering as superior
medical skill could afford.</p>
<p>Jane and her sister Cassandra took lodgings in College Street.&nbsp;
They had two kind friends living in the Close, Mrs. Heathcote and Miss
Bigg, the mother and aunt of the present Sir Wm. Heathcote of Hursley,
between whose family and ours a close friendship has existed for several
generations.&nbsp; These friends did all that they could to promote
the comfort of the sisters, during that sad sojourn in Winchester, both
by their society, and by supplying those little conveniences in which
a lodging-house was likely to be deficient.&nbsp; It was shortly after
settling in these lodgings that she wrote to a nephew <!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>the
following characteristic letter, no longer, alas in her former strong,
clear hand.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Mrs. David&rsquo;s, College St., Winton,<br />
&lsquo;Tuesday, May 27th.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is no better way, my dearest E., of thanking you for
your affectionate concern for me during my illness than by telling you
myself, as soon as possible, that I continue to get better.&nbsp; I
will not boast of my handwriting; neither that nor my face have yet
recovered their proper beauty, but in other respects I gain strength
very fast.&nbsp; I am now out of bed from 9 in the morning to 10 at
night: upon the sofa, it is true, but I eat my meals with aunt Cassandra
in a rational way, and can employ myself, and walk from one room to
another.&nbsp; Mr. Lyford says he will cure me, and if he fails, I shall
draw up a memorial and lay it before the Dean and Chapter, and have
no doubt of redress from that pious, learned, and disinterested body.&nbsp;
Our lodgings are very comfortable.&nbsp; We have a neat little drawing-room
with a bow window overlooking Dr. Gabell&rsquo;s garden. <a name="citation173"></a><a href="#footnote173">{173}</a>&nbsp;
Thanks to the kindness of your father and mother in sending me their
carriage, my journey hither on Saturday was performed with very little
fatigue, and had it been a fine day, I think I should have felt none;
but it distressed me to see uncle Henry and Wm. Knight, who kindly attended
us on <!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>horseback,
riding in the rain almost the whole way.&nbsp; We expect a visit from
them to-morrow, and hope they will stay the night; and on Thursday,
which is a confirmation and a holiday, we are to get Charles out to
breakfast.&nbsp; We have had but one visit from <i>him</i>, poor fellow,
as he is in sick-room, but he hopes to be out to-night.&nbsp; We see
Mrs. Heathcote every day, and William is to call upon us soon.&nbsp;
God bless you, my dear E.&nbsp; If ever you are ill, may you be as tenderly
nursed as I have been.&nbsp; May the same blessed alleviations of anxious,
sympathising friends be yours: and may you possess, as I dare say you
will, the greatest blessing of all in the consciousness of not being
unworthy of their love.&nbsp; <i>I</i> could not feel this.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your very affec<sup>te</sup> Aunt,<br />
&lsquo;J. A.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following extract from a letter which has been before printed,
written soon after the former, breathes the same spirit of humility
and thankfulness:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I will only say further that my dearest sister,
my tender, watchful, indefatigable nurse, has not been made ill by her
exertions.&nbsp; As to what I owe her, and the anxious affection of
all my beloved family on this occasion, I can only cry over it, and
pray God to bless them more and more.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Throughout her illness she was nursed by her sister, often assisted
by her sister-in-law, my mother.&nbsp; <!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>Both
were with her when she died.&nbsp; Two of her brothers, who were clergymen,
lived near enough to Winchester to be in frequent attendance, and to
administer the services suitable for a Christian&rsquo;s death-bed.&nbsp;
While she used the language of hope to her correspondents, she was fully
aware of her danger, though not appalled by it.&nbsp; It is true that
there was much to attach her to life.&nbsp; She was happy in her family;
she was just beginning to feel confidence in her own success; and, no
doubt, the exercise of her great talents was an enjoyment in itself.&nbsp;
We may well believe that she would gladly have lived longer; but she
was enabled without dismay or complaint to prepare for death.&nbsp;
She was a humble, believing Christian.&nbsp; Her life had been passed
in the performance of home duties, and the cultivation of domestic affections,
without any self-seeking or craving after applause.&nbsp; She had always
sought, as it were by instinct, to promote the happiness of all who
came within her influence, and doubtless she had her reward in the peace
of mind which was granted her in her last days.&nbsp; Her sweetness
of temper never failed.&nbsp; She was ever considerate and grateful
to those who attended on her.&nbsp; At times, when she felt rather better,
her playfulness of spirit revived, and she amused them even in their
sadness.&nbsp; Once, when she thought herself near her end, she said
what she imagined might be her last words to those around her, and particularly
thanked her sister-in-law for being with <!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>her,
saying: &lsquo;You have always been a kind sister to me, Mary.&rsquo;&nbsp;
When the end at last came, she sank rapidly, and on being asked by her
attendants whether there was anything that she wanted, her reply was,
&lsquo;<i>Nothing but death</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; These were her last words.&nbsp;
In quietness and peace she breathed her last on the morning of July
18, 1817.</p>
<p>On the 24th of that month she was buried in Winchester Cathedral,
near the centre of the north aisle, almost opposite to the beautiful
chantry tomb of William of Wykeham.&nbsp; A large slab of black marble
in the pavement marks the place.&nbsp; Her own family only attended
the funeral.&nbsp; Her sister returned to her desolated home, there
to devote herself, for ten years, to the care of her aged mother; and
to live much on the memory of her lost sister, till called many years
later to rejoin her.&nbsp; Her brothers went back sorrowing to their
several homes.&nbsp; They were very fond and very proud of her.&nbsp;
They were attached to her by her talents, her virtues, and her engaging
manners; and each loved afterwards to fancy a resemblance in some niece
or daughter of his own to the dear sister Jane, whose perfect equal
they yet never expected to see.</p>
<h2><!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>CHAPTER
XII.</h2>
<p><i>The Cancelled Chapter (Chap. X.) of &lsquo;Persuasion</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With all this knowledge of Mr. Elliot and this authority to impart
it, Anne left Westgate Buildings, her mind deeply busy in revolving
what she had heard, feeling, thinking, recalling, and foreseeing everything,
shocked at Mr. Elliot, sighing over future Kellynch, and pained for
Lady Russell, whose confidence in him had been entire.&nbsp; The embarrassment
which must be felt from this hour in his presence!&nbsp; How to behave
to him?&nbsp; How to get rid of him?&nbsp; What to do by any of the
party at home?&nbsp; Where to be blind?&nbsp; Where to be active?&nbsp;
It was altogether a confusion of images and doubts&mdash;a perplexity,
an agitation which she could not see the end of.&nbsp; And she was in
Gay Street, and still so much engrossed that she started on being addressed
by Admiral Croft, as if he were a person unlikely to be met there.&nbsp;
It was within a few steps of his own door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are going to call upon my wife,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;She will be very glad to see you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne denied it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No! she really had not time, she was in her way home;&rsquo;
but while she spoke the Admiral had stepped back and knocked at the
door, calling out,</p>
<p><!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>&lsquo;Yes,
yes; do go in; she is all alone; go in and rest yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne felt so little disposed at this time to be in company of any
sort, that it vexed her to be thus constrained, but she was obliged
to stop.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Since you are so very kind,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;I will
just ask Mrs. Croft how she does, but I really cannot stay five minutes.&nbsp;
You are sure she is quite alone?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The possibility of Captain Wentworth had occurred; and most fearfully
anxious was she to be assured&mdash;either that he was within, or that
he was not&mdash;<i>which</i> might have been a question.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes! quite alone, nobody but her mantua-maker with her,
and they have been shut up together this half-hour, so it must be over
soon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her mantua-maker!&nbsp; Then I am sure my calling now would
be most inconvenient.&nbsp; Indeed you must allow me to leave my card
and be so good as to explain it afterwards to Mrs. Croft.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, not at all&mdash;not at all&mdash;she will be very
happy to see you.&nbsp; Mind, I will not swear that she has not something
particular to say to you, but that will all come out in the right place.&nbsp;
I give no hints.&nbsp; Why, Miss Elliot, we begin to hear strange things
of you (smiling in her face).&nbsp; But you have not much the look of
it, as grave as a little judge!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne blushed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aye, aye, that will do now, it is all right.&nbsp; I thought
we were not mistaken.&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>She
was left to guess at the direction of his suspicions; the first wild
idea had been of some disclosure from his brother-in-law, but she was
ashamed the next moment, and felt how far more probable it was that
he should be meaning Mr. Elliot.&nbsp; The door was opened, and the
man evidently beginning to <i>deny</i> his mistress, when the sight
of his master stopped him.&nbsp; The Admiral enjoyed the joke exceedingly.&nbsp;
Anne thought his triumph over Stephen rather too long.&nbsp; At last,
however, he was able to invite her up stairs, and stepping before her
said, &lsquo;I will just go up with you myself and show you in.&nbsp;
I cannot stay, because I must go to the Post-Office, but if you will
only sit down for five minutes I am sure Sophy will come, and you will
find nobody to disturb you&mdash;there is nobody but Frederick here,&rsquo;
opening the door as he spoke.&nbsp; Such a person to be passed over
as nobody to <i>her</i>!&nbsp; After being allowed to feel quite secure,
indifferent, at her ease, to have it burst on her that she was to be
the next moment in the same room with him!&nbsp; No time for recollection!
for planning behaviour or regulating manners!&nbsp; There was time only
to turn pale before she had passed through the door, and met the astonished
eyes of Captain Wentworth, who was sitting by the fire, pretending to
read, and prepared for no greater surprise than the Admiral&rsquo;s
hasty return.</p>
<p>Equally unexpected was the meeting on each side.&nbsp; There was
nothing to be done, however, but to <!-- page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>stifle
feelings, and to be quietly polite, and the Admiral was too much on
the alert to leave any troublesome pause.&nbsp; He repeated again what
he had said before about his wife and everybody, insisted on Anne&rsquo;s
sitting down and being perfectly comfortable&mdash;was sorry he must
leave her himself, but was sure Mrs. Croft would be down very soon,
and would go upstairs and give her notice directly.&nbsp; Anne <i>was</i>
sitting down, but now she arose, again to entreat him not to interrupt
Mrs. Croft and re-urge the wish of going away and calling another time.&nbsp;
But the Admiral would not hear of it; and if she did not return to the
charge with unconquerable perseverance, or did not with a more passive
determination walk quietly out of the room (as certainly she might have
done), may she not be pardoned?&nbsp; If she <i>had</i> no horror of
a few minutes&rsquo; t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with Captain Wentworth,
may she not be pardoned for not wishing to give him the idea that she
had?&nbsp; She reseated herself, and the Admiral took leave, but on
reaching the door, said&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Frederick, a word with <i>you</i> if you please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Captain Wentworth went to him, and instantly, before they were well
out of the room, the Admiral continued&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As I am going to leave you together, it is but fair I should
give you something to talk of; and so, if you please&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here the door was very firmly closed, she could guess by which of
the two&mdash;and she lost entirely <!-- page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>what
immediately followed, but it was impossible for her not to distinguish
parts of the rest, for the Admiral, on the strength of the door&rsquo;s
being shut, was speaking without any management of voice, though she
could hear his companion trying to check him.&nbsp; She could not doubt
their being speaking of her.&nbsp; She heard her own name and Kellynch
repeatedly.&nbsp; She was very much disturbed.&nbsp; She knew not what
to do, or what to expect, and among other agonies felt the possibility
of Captain Wentworth&rsquo;s not returning into the room at all, which,
after her consenting to stay, would have been&mdash;too bad for language.&nbsp;
They seemed to be talking of the Admiral&rsquo;s lease of Kellynch.&nbsp;
She heard him say something of the lease being signed&mdash;or not signed&mdash;<i>that</i>
was not likely to be a very agitating subject, but then followed&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hate to be at an uncertainty.&nbsp; I must know at once.&nbsp;
Sophy thinks the same.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then in a lower tone Captain Wentworth seemed remonstrating, wanting
to be excused, wanting to put something off.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Phoo, phoo,&rsquo; answered the Admiral, &lsquo;now is the
time; if you will not speak, I will stop and speak myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, sir, very well, sir,&rsquo; followed with some
impatience from his companion, opening the door as he spoke&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will then, you promise you will?&rsquo; replied <!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>the
Admiral in all the power of his natural voice, unbroken even by one
thin door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, sir, yes.&rsquo;&nbsp; And the Admiral was hastily left,
the door was closed, and the moment arrived in which Anne was alone
with Captain Wentworth.</p>
<p>She could not attempt to see how he looked, but he walked immediately
to a window as if irresolute and embarrassed, and for about the space
of five seconds she repented what she had done&mdash;censured it as
unwise, blushed over it as indelicate.&nbsp; She longed to be able to
speak of the weather or the concert, but could only compass the relief
of taking a newspaper in her hand.&nbsp; The distressing pause was over,
however; he turned round in half a minute, and coming towards the table
where she sat, said in a voice of effort and constraint&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must have heard too much already, Madam, to be in any
doubt of my having promised Admiral Croft to speak to you on a particular
subject, and this conviction determines me to do so, however repugnant
to my&mdash;to all my sense of propriety to be taking so great a liberty!&nbsp;
You will acquit me of impertinence I trust, by considering me as speaking
only for another, and speaking by necessity; and the Admiral is a man
who can never be thought impertinent by one who knows him as you do.&nbsp;
His intentions are always the kindest and the best, and you will perceive
he is actuated by none other in the application which I am now, with&mdash;with
very peculiar feelings&mdash;obliged to make.&rsquo;&nbsp; He stopped,
<!-- page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>but
merely to recover breath, not seeming to expect any answer.&nbsp; Anne
listened as if her life depended on the issue of his speech.&nbsp; He
proceeded with a forced alacrity:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Admiral, Madam, was this morning confidently informed
that you were&mdash;upon my soul, I am quite at a loss, ashamed (breathing
and speaking quickly)&mdash;the awkwardness of <i>giving</i> information
of this kind to one of the parties&mdash;you can be at no loss to understand
me.&nbsp; It was very confidently said that Mr. Elliot&mdash;that everything
was settled in the family for a union between Mr. Elliot and yourself.&nbsp;
It was added that you were to live at Kellynch&mdash;that Kellynch was
to be given up.&nbsp; This the Admiral knew could not be correct.&nbsp;
But it occurred to him that it might be the <i>wish</i> of the parties.&nbsp;
And my commission from him, Madam, is to say, that if the family wish
is such, his lease of Kellynch shall be cancelled, and he and my sister
will provide themselves with another home, without imagining themselves
to be doing anything which under similar circumstances would not be
done for <i>them</i>.&nbsp; This is all, Madam.&nbsp; A very few words
in reply from you will be sufficient.&nbsp; That <i>I</i> should be
the person commissioned on this subject is extraordinary! and believe
me, Madam, it is no less painful.&nbsp; A very few words, however, will
put an end to the awkwardness and distress we may <i>both</i> be feeling.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Anne spoke a word or two, but they were unintelligible; and before
she could command herself, he <!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>added,
&lsquo;If you will only tell me that the Admiral may address a line
to Sir Walter, it will be enough.&nbsp; Pronounce only the words, <i>he
may</i>, and I shall immediately follow him with your message.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Sir,&rsquo; said Anne; &lsquo;there is no message.&nbsp;
You are misin&mdash;the Admiral is misinformed.&nbsp; I do justice to
the kindness of his intentions, but he is quite mistaken.&nbsp; There
is no truth in any such report.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was a moment silent.&nbsp; She turned her eyes towards him for
the first time since his re-entering the room.&nbsp; His colour was
varying, and he was looking at her with all the power and keenness which
she believed no other eyes than his possessed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No truth in any such report?&rsquo; he repeated.&nbsp; &lsquo;No
truth in any <i>part</i> of it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;None.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had been standing by a chair, enjoying the relief of leaning on
it, or of playing with it.&nbsp; He now sat down, drew it a little nearer
to her, and looked with an expression which had something more than
penetration in it&mdash;something softer.&nbsp; Her countenance did
not discourage.&nbsp; It was a silent but a very powerful dialogue;
on his supplication, on hers acceptance.&nbsp; Still a little nearer,
and a hand taken and pressed; and &lsquo;Anne, my own dear Anne!&rsquo;
bursting forth in all the fulness of exquisite feeling,&mdash;and all
suspense and indecision were over.&nbsp; They were re-united.&nbsp;
They were restored to all that had been lost. They were carried back
to the past with only an increase of attachment and confidence, and
<!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>only
such a flutter of present delight as made them little fit for the interruption
of Mrs. Croft when she joined them not long afterwards.&nbsp; <i>She</i>,
probably, in the observations of the next ten minutes saw something
to suspect; and though it was hardly possible for a woman of her description
to wish the mantua-maker had imprisoned her longer, she might be very
likely wishing for some excuse to run about the house, some storm to
break the windows above, or a summons to the Admiral&rsquo;s shoemaker
below.&nbsp; Fortune favoured them all, however, in another way, in
a gentle, steady rain, just happily set in as the Admiral returned and
Anne rose to go.&nbsp; She was earnestly invited to stay dinner.&nbsp;
A note was despatched to Camden Place, and she staid&mdash;staid till
ten at night; and during that time the husband and wife, either by the
wife&rsquo;s contrivance, or by simply going on in their usual way,
were frequently out of the room together&mdash;gone upstairs to hear
a noise, or downstairs to settle their accounts, or upon the landing
to trim the lamp.&nbsp; And these precious moments were turned to so
good an account that all the most anxious feelings of the past were
gone through.&nbsp; Before they parted at night, Anne had the felicity
of being assured that in the first place (so far from being altered
for the worse), she had gained inexpressibly in personal loveliness;
and that as to character, hers was now fixed on his mind as <i>perfection</i>
itself, maintaining the just medium of fortitude and gentleness&mdash;that
<!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>he
had never ceased to love and prefer her, though it had been only at
Uppercross that he had learnt to do her justice, and only at Lyme that
he had begun to understand his own feelings; that at Lyme he had received
lessons of more than one kind&mdash;the passing admiration of Mr. Elliot
had at least <i>roused</i> him, and the scene on the Cobb, and at Captain
Harville&rsquo;s, had fixed her superiority.&nbsp; In his preceding
attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove (the attempts of anger
and pique), he protested that he had continually felt the impossibility
of really caring for Louisa, though till <i>that day</i>, till the leisure
for reflection which followed it, he had not understood the perfect
excellence of the mind with which Louisa&rsquo;s could so ill bear comparison;
or the perfect, the unrivalled hold it possessed over his own.&nbsp;
There he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle
and the obstinacy of self-will, between the darings of heedlessness
and the resolution of a collected mind; there he had seen everything
to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost, and there had begun
to deplore the pride, the folly, the madness of resentment, which had
kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way.&nbsp; From
that period to the present had his penance been the most severe.&nbsp;
He had no sooner been free from the horror and remorse attending the
first few days of Louisa&rsquo;s accident, no sooner had begun to feel
himself alive again, than he had begun to feel himself, though alive,
not at liberty.</p>
<p><!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>He
found that he was considered by his friend Harville an engaged man.&nbsp;
The Harvilles entertained not a doubt of a mutual attachment between
him and Louisa; and though this to a degree was contradicted instantly,
it yet made him feel that perhaps by <i>her</i> family, by everybody,
by <i>herself</i> even, the same idea might be held, and that he was
not <i>free</i> in honour, though if such were to be the conclusion,
too free alas! in heart.&nbsp; He had never thought justly on this subject
before, and he had not sufficiently considered that his excessive intimacy
at Uppercross must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways;
and that while trying whether he could attach himself to either of the
girls, he might be exciting unpleasant reports if not raising unrequited
regard.</p>
<p>He found too late that he had entangled himself, and that precisely
as he became thoroughly satisfied of his not <i>caring</i> for Louisa
at all, he must regard himself as bound to her if her feelings for him
were what the Harvilles supposed.&nbsp; It determined him to leave Lyme,
and await her perfect recovery elsewhere.&nbsp; He would gladly weaken
by any <i>fair</i> means whatever sentiment or speculations concerning
them might exist; and he went therefore into Shropshire, meaning after
a while to return to the Crofts at Kellynch, and act as he found requisite.</p>
<p>He had remained in Shropshire, lamenting the blindness of his own
pride and the blunders of his <!-- page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>own
calculations, till at once released from Louisa by the astonishing felicity
of her engagement with Benwick.</p>
<p>Bath&mdash;Bath had instantly followed in <i>thought</i>, and not
long after in <i>fact</i>.&nbsp; To Bath&mdash;to arrive with hope,
to be torn by jealousy at the first sight of Mr. Elliot; to experience
all the changes of each at the concert; to be miserable by the morning&rsquo;s
circumstantial report, to be now more happy than language could express,
or any heart but his own be capable of.</p>
<p>He was very eager and very delightful in the description of what
he had felt at the concert; the evening seemed to have been made up
of exquisite moments.&nbsp; The moment of her stepping forward in the
octagon room to speak to him, the moment of Mr. Elliot&rsquo;s appearing
and tearing her away, and one or two subsequent moments, marked by returning
hope or increasing despondency, were dwelt on with energy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To see you,&rsquo; cried he, &lsquo;in the midst of those
who could not be my well-wishers; to see your cousin close by you, conversing
and smiling, and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties
of the match!&nbsp; To consider it as the certain wish of every being
who could hope to influence you!&nbsp; Even if your own feelings were
reluctant or indifferent, to consider what powerful support would be
his!&nbsp; Was it not enough to make the fool of me which I appeared?&nbsp;
How could I look on without agony?&nbsp; Was not the <!-- page 189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>very
sight of the friend who sat behind you; was not the recollection of
what had been, the knowledge of her influence, the indelible, immovable
impression of what persuasion had once done&mdash;was it not all against
me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You should have distinguished,&rsquo; replied Anne.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You should not have suspected me now; the case so different,
and my age so different.&nbsp; If I was wrong in yielding to persuasion
once, remember it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety, not
of risk.&nbsp; When I yielded, I thought it was to duty; but no duty
could be called in aid here.&nbsp; In marrying a man indifferent to
me, all risk would have been incurred, and all duty violated.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps I ought to have reasoned thus,&rsquo; he replied;
&lsquo;but I could not.&nbsp; I could not derive benefit from the late
knowledge I had acquired of your character.&nbsp; I could not bring
it into play; it was overwhelmed, buried, lost in those earlier feelings
which I had been smarting under year after year.&nbsp; I could think
of you only as one who had yielded, who had given me up, who had been
influenced by anyone rather than by me.&nbsp; I saw you with the very
person who had guided you in that year of misery.&nbsp; I had no reason
to believe her of less authority now.&nbsp; The force of habit was to
be added.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should have thought,&rsquo; said Anne, &lsquo;that my manner
to yourself might have spared you much or all of this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no!&nbsp; Your manner might be only the ease <!-- page 190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>which
your engagement to another man would give.&nbsp; I left you in this
belief; and yet&mdash;I was determined to see you again.&nbsp; My spirits
rallied with the morning, and I felt that I had still a motive for remaining
here.&nbsp; The Admiral&rsquo;s news, indeed, was a revulsion; since
that moment I have been divided what to do, and had it been confirmed,
this would have been my last day in Bath.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was time for all this to pass, with such interruptions only
as enhanced the charm of the communication, and Bath could hardly contain
any other two beings at once so rationally and so rapturously happy
as during that evening occupied the sofa of Mrs. Croft&rsquo;s drawing-room
in Gay Street.</p>
<p>Captain Wentworth had taken care to meet the Admiral as he returned
into the house, to satisfy him as to Mr. Elliot and Kellynch; and the
delicacy of the Admiral&rsquo;s good-nature kept him from saying another
word on the subject to Anne.&nbsp; He was quite concerned lest he might
have been giving her pain by touching on a tender part&mdash;who could
say?&nbsp; She might be liking her cousin better than he liked her;
and, upon recollection, if they had been to marry at all, why should
they have waited so long?&nbsp; When the evening closed, it is probable
that the Admiral received some new ideas from his wife, whose particularly
friendly manner in parting with her gave Anne the gratifying persuasion
of her seeing and approving.&nbsp; It had been such a day to Anne; the
hours which had passed <!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>since
her leaving Camden Place had done so much!&nbsp; She was almost bewildered&mdash;almost
too happy in looking back.&nbsp; It was necessary to sit up half the
night, and lie awake the remainder, to comprehend with composure her
present state, and pay for the overplus of bliss by headache and fatigue.</p>

<p><i>The Last Work</i>.</p>
<p>Jane Austen was taken from us: how much unexhausted talent perished
with her, how largely she might yet have contributed to the entertainment
of her readers, if her life had been prolonged, cannot be known; but
it is certain that the mine at which she had so long laboured was not
worked out, and that she was still diligently employed in collecting
fresh materials from it.&nbsp; &lsquo;Persuasion&rsquo; had been finished
in August 1816; some time was probably given to correcting it for the
press; but on the 27th of the following January, according to the date
on her own manuscript, she began a new novel, and worked at it up to
the 17th of March.&nbsp; The chief part of this manuscript is written
in her usual firm and neat hand, but some of the latter pages seem to
have been first traced in pencil, probably when she was too weak to
sit long at her desk, and written over in ink afterwards.&nbsp; The
quantity produced does not indicate any decline of power or industry,
for in those seven weeks twelve chapters had been completed.&nbsp; It
is more difficult to judge of the quality of a work so little advanced.&nbsp;
It had received no name; there was scarcely any indication <!-- page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>what
the course of the story was to be, nor was any heroine yet perceptible,
who, like Fanny Price, or Anne Elliot, might draw round her the sympathies
of the reader.&nbsp; Such an unfinished fragment cannot be presented
to the public; but I am persuaded that some of Jane Austen&rsquo;s admirers
will be glad to learn something about the latest creations which were
forming themselves in her mind; and therefore, as some of the principal
characters were already sketched in with a vigorous hand, I will try
to give an idea of them, illustrated by extracts from the work.</p>
<p>The scene is laid at Sanditon, a village on the Sussex coast, just
struggling into notoriety as a bathing-place, under the patronage of
the two principal proprietors of the parish, Mr. Parker and Lady Denham.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker was an amiable man, with more enthusiasm than judgment,
whose somewhat shallow mind overflowed with the one idea of the prosperity
of Sanditon, together with a jealous contempt of the rival village of
Brinshore, where a similar attempt was going on.&nbsp; To the regret
of his much-enduring wife, he had left his family mansion, with all
its ancestral comforts of gardens, shrubberies, and shelter, situated
in a valley some miles inland, and had built a new residence&mdash;a
Trafalgar House&mdash;on the bare brow of the hill overlooking Sanditon
and the sea, exposed to every wind that blows; but he will confess to
no discomforts, nor suffer his family <!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>to
feel any from the change.&nbsp; The following extract brings him before
the reader, mounted on his hobby:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He wanted to secure the promise of a visit, and to get as
many of the family as his own house would hold to follow him to Sanditon
as soon as possible; and, healthy as all the Heywoods undeniably were,
he foresaw that every one of them would be benefitted by the sea.&nbsp;
He held it indeed as certain that no person, however upheld for the
present by fortuitous aids of exercise and spirit in a semblance of
health, could be really in a state of secure and permanent health without
spending at least six weeks by the sea every year.&nbsp; The sea air
and sea-bathing together were nearly infallible; one or other of them
being a match for every disorder of the stomach, the lungs, or the blood.&nbsp;
They were anti-spasmodic, anti-pulmonary, anti-bilious, and anti-rheumatic.&nbsp;
Nobody could catch cold by the sea; nobody wanted appetite by the sea;
nobody wanted spirits; nobody wanted strength.&nbsp; They were healing,
softening, relaxing, fortifying, and bracing, seemingly just as was
wanted; sometimes one, sometimes the other.&nbsp; If the sea breeze
failed, the sea-bath was the certain corrective; and when bathing disagreed,
the sea breeze was evidently designed by nature for the cure.&nbsp;
His eloquence, however, could not prevail.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Heywood
never left home. . . .&nbsp; The maintenance, education, and fitting
out of fourteen children demanded a very <!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>quiet,
settled, careful course of life; and obliged them to be stationary and
healthy at Willingden.&nbsp; What prudence had at first enjoined was
now rendered pleasant by habit.&nbsp; They never left home, and they
had a gratification in saying so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Denham&rsquo;s was a very different character.&nbsp; She was
a rich vulgar widow, with a sharp but narrow mind, who cared for the
prosperity of Sanditon only so far as it might increase the value of
her own property.&nbsp; She is thus described:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lady Denham had been a rich Miss Brereton, born to wealth,
but not to education.&nbsp; Her first husband had been a Mr. Hollis,
a man of considerable property in the country, of which a large share
of the parish of Sanditon, with manor and mansion-house, formed a part.&nbsp;
He had been an elderly man when she married him; her own age about thirty.&nbsp;
Her motives for such a match could be little understood at the distance
of forty years, but she had so well nursed and pleased Mr. Hollis that
at his death he left her everything&mdash;all his estates, and all at
her disposal.&nbsp; After a widowhood of some years she had been induced
to marry again.&nbsp; The late Sir Harry Denham, of Denham Park, in
the neighbourhood of Sanditon, succeeded in removing her and her large
income to his own domains; but he could not succeed in the views of
permanently enriching his family which were attributed to him.&nbsp;
She had been too wary to put anything out of her own power, and when,
on Sir Harry&rsquo;s death, she returned again to <!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>her
own house at Sanditon, she was said to have made this boast, &ldquo;that
though she had <i>got</i> nothing but her title from the family, yet
she had <i>given</i> nothing for it.&rdquo;&nbsp; For the title it was
to be supposed that she married.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lady Denham was indeed a great lady, beyond the common wants
of society; for she had many thousands a year to bequeath, and three
distinct sets of people to be courted by:&mdash;her own relations, who
might very reasonably wish for her original thirty thousand pounds among
them; the legal heirs of Mr. Hollis, who might hope to be more indebted
to <i>her</i> sense of justice than he had allowed them to be to <i>his</i>;
and those members of the Denham family for whom her second husband had
hoped to make a good bargain.&nbsp; By all these, or by branches of
them, she had, no doubt, been long and still continued to be well attacked;
and of these three divisions Mr. Parker did not hesitate to say that
Mr. Hollis&rsquo;s kindred were the least in favour, and Sir Harry Denham&rsquo;s
the most. The former, he believed, had done themselves irremediable
harm by expressions of very unwise resentment at the time of Mr. Hollis&rsquo;s
death: the latter, to the advantage of being the remnant of a connection
which she certainly valued, joined those of having been known to her
from their childhood, and of being always at hand to pursue their interests
by seasonable attentions.&nbsp; But another claimant was now to be taken
into account: a young female <!-- page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>relation
whom Lady Denham had been induced to receive into her family.&nbsp;
After having always protested against any such addition, and often enjoyed
the repeated defeat she had given to every attempt of her own relations
to introduce &lsquo;this young lady, or that young lady,&rsquo; as a
companion at Sanditon House, she had brought back with her from London
last Michaelmas a Miss Clara Brereton, who bid fair to vie in favour
with Sir Edward Denham, and to secure for herself and her family that
share of the accumulated property which they had certainly the best
right to inherit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Denham&rsquo;s character comes out in a conversation which takes
place at Mr. Parker&rsquo;s tea-table.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The conversation turned entirely upon Sanditon, its present
number of visitants, and the chances of a good season.&nbsp; It was
evident that Lady Denham had more anxiety, more fears of loss than her
coadjutor.&nbsp; She wanted to have the place fill faster, and seemed
to have many harassing apprehensions of the lodgings being in some instances
underlet.&nbsp; To a report that a large boarding-school was expected
she replies, &lsquo;Ah, well, no harm in that.&nbsp; They will stay
their six weeks, and out of such a number who knows but some may be
consumptive, and want asses&rsquo; milk; and I have two milch asses
at this very time.&nbsp; But perhaps the little Misses may hurt the
furniture.&nbsp; I hope they will have a good sharp governess to look
after them.&rsquo;&nbsp; But she wholly <!-- page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>disapproved
of Mr. Parker&rsquo;s wish to secure the residence of a medical man
amongst them.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, what should we do with a doctor here?&nbsp;
It would only be encouraging our servants and the poor to fancy themselves
ill, if there was a doctor at hand.&nbsp; Oh, pray let us have none
of that tribe at Sanditon: we go on very well as we are.&nbsp; There
is the sea, and the downs, and my milch asses: and I have told Mrs.
Whitby that if anybody enquires for a chamber horse, they may be supplied
at a fair rate (poor Mr. Hollis&rsquo;s chamber horse, as good as new);
and what can people want more?&nbsp; I have lived seventy good years
in the world, and never took physic, except twice: and never saw the
face of a doctor in all my life on my own account; and I really believe
if my poor dear Sir Harry had never seen one neither, he would have
been alive now.&nbsp; Ten fees, one after another, did the men take
who sent him out of the world.&nbsp; I beseech you, Mr. Parker, no doctors
here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This lady&rsquo;s character comes out more strongly in a conversation
with Mr. Parker&rsquo;s guest, Miss Charlotte Heywood.&nbsp; Sir Edward
Denham with his sister Esther and Clara Brereton have just left them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Charlotte accepted an invitation from Lady Denham to remain
with her on the terrace, when the others adjourned to the library.&nbsp;
Lady Denham, like a true great lady, talked, and talked only of her
own concerns, and Charlotte listened.&nbsp; Taking hold of Charlotte&rsquo;s
arm with the ease of one who felt that any notice from her was a favour,
and <!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>communicative
from the same sense of importance, or from a natural love of talking,
she immediately said in a tone of great satisfaction, and with a look
of arch sagacity:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Esther wants me to invite her and her brother to spend
a week with me at Sanditon House, as I did last summer, but I shan&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
She has been trying to get round me every way with her praise of this
and her praise of that; but I saw what she was about.&nbsp; I saw through
it all.&nbsp; I am not very easily taken in, my dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Charlotte could think of nothing more harmless to be said than the
simple enquiry of, &lsquo;Sir Edward and Miss Denham?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, my dear; <i>my young folks</i>, as I call them, sometimes:
for I take them very much by the hand, and had them with me last summer,
about this time, for a week&mdash;from Monday to Monday&mdash;and very
delighted and thankful they were.&nbsp; For they are very good young
people, my dear.&nbsp; I would not have you think that I only notice
them for poor dear Sir Harry&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; No, no; they are very
deserving themselves, or, trust me, they would not be so much in my
company.&nbsp; I am not the woman to help anybody blindfold.&nbsp; I
always take care to know what I am about, and who I have to deal with
before I stir a finger.&nbsp; I do not think I was ever overreached
in my life; and that is a good deal for a woman to say that has been
twice married.&nbsp; Poor dear Sir Harry (between ourselves) thought
<!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>at
first to have got more, but (with a bit of a sigh) he is gone, and we
must not find fault with the dead.&nbsp; Nobody could live happier together
than us: and he was a very honourable man, quite the gentleman, of ancient
family; and when he died I gave Sir Edward his gold watch.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was said with a look at her companion which implied its right
to produce a great impression; and seeing no rapturous astonishment
in Charlotte&rsquo;s countenance, she added quickly,</p>
<p>&lsquo;He did not bequeath it to his nephew, my dear; it was no bequest;
it was not in the will.&nbsp; He only told me, and <i>that</i> but <i>once</i>,
that he should wish his nephew to have his watch; but it need not have
been binding, if I had not chose it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very kind indeed, very handsome!&rsquo; said Charlotte, absolutely
forced to affect admiration.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, my dear; and it is not the only kind thing I have done
by him.&nbsp; I have been a very liberal friend to Sir Edward; and,
poor young man, he needs it bad enough.&nbsp; For, though I am only
the dowager, my dear, and he is the heir, things do not stand between
us in the way they usually do between those two parties.&nbsp; Not a
shilling do I receive from the Denham estate.&nbsp; Sir Edward has no
payments to make <i>me</i>.&nbsp; <i>He</i> don&rsquo;t stand uppermost,
believe me; it is <i>I</i> that help <i>him</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed! he is a very fine young man, and particularly elegant
in his address.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was said chiefly for the sake of saying <!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>something;
but Charlotte directly saw that it was laying her open to suspicion,
by Lady Denham&rsquo;s giving a shrewd glance at her, and replying,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes; he&rsquo;s very well to look at; and it is to be
hoped that somebody of large fortune will think so; for Sir Edward <i>must</i>
marry for money.&nbsp; He and I often talk that matter over.&nbsp; A
handsome young man like him will go smirking and smiling about, and
paying girls compliments, but he knows he <i>must</i> marry for money.&nbsp;
And Sir Edward is a very steady young man, in the main, and has got
very good notions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir Edward Denham,&rsquo; said Charlotte, &lsquo;with such
personal advantages, may be almost sure of getting a woman of fortune,
if he chooses it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This glorious sentiment seemed quite to remove suspicion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aye, my dear, that is very sensibly said; and if we could
but get a young heiress to Sanditon!&nbsp; But heiresses are monstrous
scarce!&nbsp; I do not think we have had an heiress here, nor even a
<i>Co</i>., since Sanditon has been a public place.&nbsp; Families come
after families, but, as far as I can learn, it is not one in a hundred
of them that have any real property, landed or funded.&nbsp; An income,
perhaps, but no property.&nbsp; Clergymen, may be, or lawyers from town,
or half-pay officers, or widows with only a jointure; and what good
can such people do to anybody?&nbsp; Except just as they take our empty
houses, and (between ourselves) I think they are great fools <!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>for
not staying at home.&nbsp; Now, if we could get a young heiress to be
sent here for her health, and, as soon as she got well, have her fall
in love with Sir Edward!&nbsp; And Miss Esther must marry somebody of
fortune, too.&nbsp; She must get a rich husband.&nbsp; Ah! young ladies
that have no money are very much to be pitied.&rsquo;&nbsp; After a
short pause: &lsquo;If Miss Esther thinks to talk me into inviting them
to come and stay at Sanditon House, she will find herself mistaken.&nbsp;
Matters are altered with me since last summer, you know: I have Miss
Clara with me now, which makes a great difference.&nbsp; I should not
choose to have my two housemaid&rsquo;s time taken up all the morning
in dusting out bedrooms.&nbsp; They have Miss Clara&rsquo;s room to
put to rights, as well as mine, every day.&nbsp; If they had hard work,
they would want higher wages.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Charlotte&rsquo;s feelings were divided between amusement and indignation.&nbsp;
She kept her countenance, and kept a civil silence; but without attempting
to listen any longer, and only conscious that Lady Denham was still
talking in the same way, allowed her own thoughts to form themselves
into such meditation as this:&mdash;&lsquo;She is thoroughly mean; I
had no expectation of anything so bad.&nbsp; Mr. Parker spoke too mildly
of her.&nbsp; He is too kind-hearted to see clearly, and their very
connection misleads him.&nbsp; He has persuaded her to engage in the
same speculation, and because they have so far the same object in view,
he fancies that she feels like him in <!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>other
things; but she is very, very mean.&nbsp; I can see no good in her.&nbsp;
Poor Miss Brereton!&nbsp; And it makes everybody mean about her.&nbsp;
This poor Sir Edward and his sister! how far nature meant them to be
respectable I cannot tell; but they are obliged to be mean in their
servility to her; and I am mean, too, in giving her my attention with
the appearance of coinciding with her.&nbsp; Thus it is when rich people
are sordid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Parker has two unmarried sisters of singular character.&nbsp;
They live together; Diana, the younger, always takes the lead, and the
elder follows in the same track.&nbsp; It is their pleasure to fancy
themselves invalids to a degree and in a manner never experienced by
others; but, from a state of exquisite pain and utter prostration, Diana
Parker can always rise to be officious in the concerns of all her acquaintance,
and to make incredible exertions where they are not wanted.</p>
<p>It would seem that they must be always either very busy for the good
of others, or else extremely ill themselves.&nbsp; Some natural delicacy
of constitution, in fact, with an unfortunate turn for medicine, especially
quack medicine, had given them an early tendency at various times to
various disorders.&nbsp; The rest of their suffering was from their
own fancy, the love of distinction, and the love of the wonderful.&nbsp;
They had charitable hearts and many amiable feelings; but a spirit of
restless activity, and the glory of doing more than anybody else, had
a share in <!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>every
exertion of benevolence, and there was vanity in all they did, as well
as in all they endured.</p>
<p>These peculiarities come out in the following letter of Diana Parker
to her brother:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear Tom</span>,&mdash;We
were much grieved at your accident, and if you had not described yourself
as having fallen into such very good hands, I should have been with
you at all hazards the day after receipt of your letter, though it found
me suffering under a more severe attack than usual of my old grievance,
spasmodic bile, and hardly able to crawl from my bed to the sofa.&nbsp;
But how were you treated?&nbsp; Send me more particulars in your next.&nbsp;
If indeed a simple sprain, as you denominate it, nothing would have
been so judicious as friction&mdash;friction by the hand alone, supposing
it could be applied <i>immediately</i>.&nbsp; Two years ago I happened
to be calling on Mrs. Sheldon, when her coachman sprained his foot,
as he was cleaning the carriage, and could hardly limp into the house;
but by the immediate use of friction alone, steadily persevered in (I
rubbed his ancle with my own hands for four hours without intermission),
he was well in three days. . . .&nbsp; Pray never run into peril again
in looking for an apothecary on our account; for had you the most experienced
man in his line settled at Sanditon, it would be no recommendation to
us.&nbsp; We have entirely done with the whole medical tribe.&nbsp;
We have consulted physician after physician in vain, <!-- page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>till
we are quite convinced that they can do nothing for us, and that we
must trust to our knowledge of our own wretched constitutions for any
relief; but if you think it advisable for the interests of the <i>place</i>
to get a medical man there, I will undertake the commission with pleasure,
and have no doubt of succeeding.&nbsp; I could soon put the necessary
irons in the fire.&nbsp; As for getting to Sanditon myself, it is an
impossibility.&nbsp; I grieve to say that I cannot attempt it, but my
feelings tell me too plainly that in my present state the sea-air would
probably be the death of me; and in truth I doubt whether Susan&rsquo;s
nerves would be equal to the effort.&nbsp; She has been suffering much
from headache, and six leeches a day, for ten days together, relieved
her so little that we thought it right to change our measures; and being
convinced on examination that much of the evil lay in her gums, I persuaded
her to attack the disorder there.&nbsp; She has accordingly had three
teeth drawn, and is decidedly better; but her nerves are a good deal
deranged, she can only speak in a whisper, and fainted away this morning
on poor Arthur&rsquo;s trying to suppress a cough.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within a week of the date of this letter, in spite of the impossibility
of moving, and of the fatal effects to be apprehended from the sea-air,
Diana Parker was at Sanditon with her sister.&nbsp; She had flattered
herself that by her own indefatigable exertions, and by setting at work
the agency of many friends, she had induced two large families to <!-- page 206--><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>take
houses at Sanditon.&nbsp; It was to expedite these politic views that
she came; and though she met with some disappointment of her expectation,
yet she did not suffer in health.</p>
<p>Such were some of the <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>, ready dressed
and prepared for their parts.&nbsp; They are at least original and unlike
any that the author had produced before.&nbsp; The success of the piece
must have depended on the skill with which these parts might be played;
but few will be inclined to distrust the skill of one who had so often
succeeded.&nbsp; If the author had lived to complete her work, it is
probable that these personages might have grown into as mature an individuality
of character, and have taken as permanent a place amongst our familiar
acquaintance, as Mr. Bennet, or John Thorp, Mary Musgrove, or Aunt Norris
herself.</p>
<h2><!-- page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>CHAPTER
XIV.</h2>
<p><i>Postscript</i>.</p>
<p>When first I was asked to put together a memoir of my aunt, I saw
reasons for declining the attempt.&nbsp; It was not only that, having
passed the three score years and ten usually allotted to man&rsquo;s
strength, and being unaccustomed to write for publication, I might well
distrust my ability to complete the work, but that I also knew the extreme
scantiness of the materials out of which it must be constructed.&nbsp;
The grave closed over my aunt fifty-two years ago; and during that long
period no idea of writing her life had been entertained by any of her
family.&nbsp; Her nearest relatives, far from making provision for such
a purpose, had actually destroyed many of the letters and papers by
which it might have been facilitated.&nbsp; They were influenced, I
believe, partly by an extreme dislike to publishing private details,
and partly by never having assumed that the world would take so strong
and abiding an interest in her works as to claim her name as public
property.&nbsp; It was therefore necessary for me to draw upon recollections
rather than on written documents for my materials; while the subject
itself supplied me with nothing striking or prominent with which to
<!-- page 208--><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>arrest
the attention of the reader.&nbsp; It has been said that the happiest
individuals, like nations during their happiest periods, have no history.&nbsp;
In the case of my aunt, it was not only that her course of life was
unvaried, but that her own disposition was remarkably calm and even.&nbsp;
There was in her nothing eccentric or angular; no ruggedness of temper;
no singularity of manner; none of the morbid sensibility or exaggeration
of feeling, which not unfrequently accompanies great talents, to be
worked up into a picture.&nbsp; Hers was a mind well balanced on a basis
of good sense, sweetened by an affectionate heart, and regulated by
fixed principles; so that she was to be distinguished from many other
amiable and sensible women only by that peculiar genius which shines
out clearly enough in her works, but of which a biographer can make
little use.&nbsp; The motive which at last induced me to make the attempt
is exactly expressed in the passage prefixed to these pages.&nbsp; I
thought that I saw something to be done: knew of no one who could do
it but myself, and so was driven to the enterprise.&nbsp; I am glad
that I have been able to finish my work.&nbsp; As a family record it
can scarcely fail to be interesting to those relatives who must ever
set a high value on their connection with Jane Austen, and to them I
especially dedicate it; but as I have been asked to do so, I also submit
it to the censure of the public, with all its faults both of deficiency
and redundancy.&nbsp; I know that its value <!-- page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>in
their eyes must depend, not on any merits of its own, but on the degree
of estimation in which my aunt&rsquo;s works may still be held; and
indeed I shall esteem it one of the strongest testimonies ever borne
to her talents, if for her sake an interest can be taken in so poor
a sketch as I have been able to draw.</p>

Sept. 7, 1869.</p>
<p><i>Postscript printed at the end of the first edition; omitted from
the second</i>.</p>
<p>Since these pages were in type, I have read with astonishment the
strange misrepresentation of my aunt&rsquo;s manners given by Miss Mitford
in a letter which appears in her lately-published Life, vol. i. p. 305.&nbsp;
Miss Mitford does not profess to have known Jane Austen herself, but
to report what had been told her by her mother.&nbsp; Having stated
that her mother &lsquo;<i>before her marriage</i>&rsquo; was well acquainted
with Jane Austen and her family, she writes thus:&mdash;&lsquo;Mamma
says that she was <i>then</i> the prettiest, silliest, most affected,
husband-hunting butterfly she ever remembers.&rsquo;&nbsp; The editor
of Miss Mitford&rsquo;s Life very properly observes in a note how different
this description is from <!-- page 210--><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>&lsquo;every
other account of Jane Austen from whatever quarter.&rsquo;&nbsp; Certainly
it is so totally at variance with the modest simplicity of character
which I have attributed to my aunt, that if it could be supposed to
have a semblance of truth, it must be equally injurious to her memory
and to my trustworthiness as her biographer.&nbsp; Fortunately I am
not driven to put my authority in competition with that of Miss Mitford,
nor to ask which ought to be considered the better witness in this case;
because I am able to prove by a reference to dates that Miss Mitford
must have been under a mistake, and that her mother could not possibly
have known what she was supposed to have reported; inasmuch as Jane
Austen, at the time referred to, was a little girl.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mitford was the daughter of Dr. Russell, Rector of Ashe, a parish
adjoining Steventon, so that the families of Austen and Russell must
at that time have been known to each other.&nbsp; But the date assigned
by Miss Mitford for the termination of the acquaintance is the time
of her mother&rsquo;s marriage.&nbsp; This took place in October 1785,
when Jane, who had been born in December 1775, was not quite ten years
old.&nbsp; In point of fact, however, Miss Russell&rsquo;s opportunities
of observing Jane Austen must have come to an end still earlier: for
upon Dr. Russell&rsquo;s death, in January 1783, his widow and daughter
removed from the neighbourhood, so that all intercourse between the
families <!-- page 211--><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>ceased
when Jane was little more than seven years old.</p>
<p>All persons who undertake to narrate from hearsay things which are
supposed to have taken place before they were born are liable to error,
and are apt to call in imagination to the aid of memory: and hence it
arises that many a fancy piece has been substituted for genuine history.</p>
<p>I do not care to correct the inaccurate account of Jane Austen&rsquo;s
manners in after life: because Miss Mitford candidly expresses a doubt
whether she had not been misinformed on that point.</p>

<p><a name="footnote1"></a><a href="#citation1">{1}</a>&nbsp; I went
to represent my father, who was too unwell to attend himself, and thus
I was the only one of my generation present.</p>
<p><a name="footnote3"></a><a href="#citation3">{3}</a>&nbsp; My chief
assistants have been my sisters, Mrs. B. Lefroy and Miss Austen, whose
recollections of our aunt are, on some points, more vivid than my own.&nbsp;
I have not only been indebted to their memory for facts, but have sometimes
used their words.&nbsp; Indeed some passages towards the end of the
work were entirely written by the latter.</p>
<p>I have also to thank some of my cousins, and especially the daughters
of Admiral Charles Austen, for the use of letters and papers which had
passed into their hands, without which this Memoir, scanty as it is,
could not have been written.</p>
<p><a name="footnote5"></a><a href="#citation5">{5}</a>&nbsp; There
seems to have been some doubt as to the validity of this election; for
Hearne says that it was referred to the Visitor, who confirmed it.&nbsp;

<p><a name="footnote31"></a><a href="#citation31">{31}</a>&nbsp; The
celebrated Beau Brummel, who was so intimate with George IV. as to be
able to quarrel with him, was born in 1771.&nbsp; It is reported that
when he was questioned about his parents, he replied that it was long
since he had heard of them, but that he imagined the worthy couple must
have cut their own throats by that time, because when he last saw them
they were eating peas with their knives.&nbsp; Yet Brummel&rsquo;s father
had probably lived in good society; and was certainly able to put his
son into a fashionable regiment, and to leave him 30,000 pounds. <a name="citation31a"></a><a href="#footnote31a">{31a}</a>&nbsp;
Raikes believes that he had been Secretary to Lord North.&nbsp; Thackeray&rsquo;s
idea that he had been a footman cannot stand against the authority of
Raikes, who was intimate with the son.</p>

who had survived the fashion of wearing swords were known to regret
the disuse of that custom, because it put an end to one way of distinguishing
those who had, from those who had not, been used to good society.&nbsp;
To wear the sword easily was an art which, like swimming and skating,
required to be learned in youth.&nbsp; Children could practise it early
with their toy swords adapted to their size.</p>

letter refer to a ball annually given at Hurstbourne Park, on the anniversary
of the Earl of Portsmouth&rsquo;s marriage with his first wife.&nbsp;
He was the Lord Portsmouth whose eccentricities afterwards became notorious,
and the invitations, as well as other arrangements about these balls,
were of a peculiar character.</p>

A greater genius than my aunt shared with her the imputation of being
<i>commonplace</i>.&nbsp; Lockhart, speaking of the low estimation in
which Scott&rsquo;s conversational powers were held in the literary
and scientific society of Edinburgh, says: &lsquo;I think the epithet
most in vogue concerning it was &ldquo;commonplace.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp;
He adds, however, that one of the most eminent of that society was of
a different opinion, who, when some glib youth chanced to echo in his
hearing the consolatory tenet of local mediocrity, answered quietly,
&ldquo;I have the misfortune to think differently from you&mdash;in
my humble opinion Walter Scott&rsquo;s sense is a still more wonderful
thing than his genius.&rdquo;&mdash;Lockhart&rsquo;s <i>Life of Scott</i>,

<p><a name="footnote140"></a><a href="#citation140">{140}</a>&nbsp;
Lockhart had supposed that this article had been written by Scott, because
it exactly accorded with the opinions which Scott had often been heard
to express, but he learned afterwards that it had been written by Whately;
and Lockhart, who became the Editor of the Quarterly, must have had
the means of knowing the truth.&nbsp; (See Lockhart&rsquo;s <i>Life
of Sir Walter Scott</i>, vol. v. p. 158.)&nbsp; I remember that, at
the time when the review came out, it was reported in Oxford that Whately
had written the article at the request of the lady whom he afterwards
married.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
